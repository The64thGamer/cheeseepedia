Hello i am pizzaman49 I live in Houston Texas and love retro things my favorite location is Northridge for it being very retro even tho it is getting the 2.0 remodel I heard it is keeping the bots
I will probably never see a chuck e cheese bot ever again because of the ABOMINATION known as 2.0 which should burn with a flamethrower. which is why my childhood store is just another pizza place to me which is why I would now rather go to Cicis than chuck e cheese because it no longer has classic elements to it that made it special to other Pizza Places.
