<h2> What’s up cool kids! </h2>
What’s up? I’m Pach. I like adding pictures and adding info

<h2> Where am I from? </h2>
I was born in the Muskoka area of Ontario, Canada. My family and I moved to Maryland in 2015. I love both of my homelands dearly. Here’s a picture right on the Lake of Bays, a 5 minute walk from my Canadian home. My ancestry is Croatian! Go Hrvatska!
<h2> When was I born? </h2>
I was born on November 20, 2006. I am 17 years old and a Senior in High School
<h2> What do I do for a living, What are my hobbies? </h2>
I work at the Chuck E. Cheese in REDACTED and I play AA hockey. I hope to be a Catholic Priest one day and I LOVE all things Chuck E. Cheese’s!

<h2> General Announcement </h2>
Uhh, hey. I think I speak for all the fandom when I say we gotta stop the complete banter, toxicity and um…NSFW stuff?? To say the least. Believe it or not, it’s kinda frowned upon. Let’s make our fandom the "best of the band!" and have it stand out as a beacon of unity and friendship.
