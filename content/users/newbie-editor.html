Hey there! I`m newbie! My name makes it seem like I'm new to the wiki, but I'm not new anymore.
I dont make massive edits or add much to pages I edit, usually I just fix typos, and add small amounts
of info. I am a fan of the Walten files, and Im also intrested in the hunt for more images and info of
the Portrait animatronics, Both winchester and Kooser rd.
My favorite chuck design: 32m Late night Chuck E Cheese.
My favorite billy bob design: Mijjin billy bob
You can contact me On discord. My user is bub and I`m active inside the Animatronic Game Hub (AGH) server.
