Hello, I'm Joshua. I exist I guess.
Some dumb aspie from Virginia who's into the funny pizza rat and bear, monster trucks, roller coasters, vinyl, heavy metal, and whatnot.
I'm currently in the process of finding as much info on the Richmond (Midlothian), VA Chuck E. Cheese location, a location I hold dearly, as it's the one I've visited the most as a kid. I'll try to add as much as I possibly can in regards to that location.
Locations I've visited
Richmond (Midlothian) (2001-2011, 2013, 2015-2019, 2022)
