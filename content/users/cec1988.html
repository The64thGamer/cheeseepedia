Hiya, I'm CEC1988, I enjoy many things, CEC Being one of them, That was my first interest, I have a passion for CEC since 2013, The first location I visited Was {{< wiki-link "Garden Grove, CA (13101 Harbor Blvd)" >}} way back in April 2013(I missed the CECP Logo in 2011 :( lol can't blame myself ) I'm 14 Irl, My Most Visited Location is {{< wiki-link "Chino, CA (5250 Philadelphia St)" >}} Which I've visited since 2014 when I moved, Hence why I have 1988 in my Profile name. Chino is really underrated, it housed the first {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}} in California, and was A ShowBiz Pizza! I always wanted to see a 3-Stage (for some reason I thought {{< wiki-link "Diamond Bar, CA (1900 S Brea Canyon Rd)" >}} Housed one lol). I want to own a Cyberamic Chuck. E. one day, Maybe when a location remodels, I know Cyberstar Chuck Reserved {{< wiki-link "La Mesa, CA (5500 Grossmont Center Dr)" >}} So that only leaves me Huntington Beach! Hope i'm not late to the game!

I edit with what I can, I know Chino a lot because I have friends which have pictures of Chino when they were Young, That's why i could confirm that they had the Chuck E Cheese Pizza Logo like La Mesa's until 1996, Bu- Hmm I should change something..
So recently I got the Wink From {{< wiki-link "Diamond Bar, CA (1900 S Brea Canyon Rd)" >}}, Someone was selling a Wink For Dirt Cheap at a garage Sale, they said they didn't want it anymore and that they got it near a CEC in Diamond Bar, so I bought it! I wont be posting pictures of the Wink Right now. I need to restore him! :)
Have a Chuck. E. Day!!!
