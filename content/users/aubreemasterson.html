Hey everybody, my name is Aubree, and I am a girl with autism and ADHD who has a good obsession with Chuck E. Cheese. My local location is the {{< wiki-link "Altoona, PA (3415 Pleasant Valley Blvd)" >}} location, so I go there for any updates and fun. I'm planning to go to more locations in the future.
<h2> Fun facts </h2><ul><li>17-years-old</li><li>April 25th is my birthday (Birthday message? I prefer the {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '92" >}} and the 'New Birthday' song, the one that goes 'Na na-na na!').</li><li>Tux and Avenger eras are my favorites (I also enjoy the PTT era, but mainly the one with Broadway Helen).</li><li>Presumably first went there when I was two in February 2010.</li><li>I went there a lot between 2011-2013.</li><li>Besides Chuck E. Cheese, I also enjoy <i>Winx Club</i>, <i>South Park</i>, <i>Clone High</i>, <i>6teen</i>, <i>Total Drama</i>, the Muppets (and Muppet Babies), <i>Kim Possible</i>, Disney stuff, etc.</li><li>I have a really good (and probably the most accurate) voice impression on Karlisa McKinney's Helen Henny (though my natural voice sounds like Annagrey Labasse's Helen Henny).</li><li>I LUV THE COMMERCIALS WITH CARTOON AVENGER CHUCK!!!!</li><li>I grew up with it at the end of the Avenger era and the Rockstar era.</li><li>Went to my local location after it reopened with the 2010 version of the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} in 2011.</li><li>My favorite characters are Chuck E. and Helen Henny. My favorite eras of Chuck are the Tux, Cool, and Avenger eras, while my favorite eras of Helen are the PTT (Broadway), Tux, and Avenger eras. As for the voices, my favorite Chuck E's voices are Scott Wilson (especially the Tux era voice) and Duncan Brannan (nostalgic and fun), while my favorite Helen Henny's voices are Paula Mulcahy (the low and high notes are awesome), Nancy Lenihan (has an amazing singing voice), Karlisa McKinney (especially, it sounds soooooooo adorable and cute and it's a shame that her singing voice was replaced), and Annagrey Labasse (such a great singer).</li><li>I ABSOLUTELY LUV THE MUSIC IN THE TUX ERA! IT JUST SOUNDS SOOOOO GOOD!!! The Avenger era music also sounds great too!</li><li>I LOATHE THE {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}!!!!</li><li>My first birthday party at CEC was back in April 2011 (prior to the 2011 remodel). I had two birthday parties at the same location: One with my dad's side and one with my mom's side. So glad that I had the 2009 Birthday Star party because I wanted to have one so bad prior to that. Any of the Rockstar era birthday parties I had just doesn't feel the same as it was.</li><li>I don't like that Kidz Bop songs would be added in the Rockstar era shows.</li></ul>
