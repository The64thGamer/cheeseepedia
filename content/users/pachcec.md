## What do I do for a living, What are my hobbies?

I work at the Chuck E. Cheese in REDACTED and I play AA hockey. I hope to be a Catholic Priest one day and I LOVE all things Chuck E. Cheese's!

## General Announcement

Uhh, hey. I think I speak for all the fandom when I say we gotta stop the complete banter, toxicity and um...NSFW stuff?? To say the least. Believe it or not, it's kinda frowned upon. Let's make our fandom the "best of the band!" and have it stand out as a beacon of unity and friendship.
