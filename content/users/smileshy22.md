Hi, I'm smileshy22 (aka britishchick09 on social media)! I've known about CEC since my birthday in 2007, but didn't become a fan until July 2024. I love the Rock-afire, especially Mitzi and Rolfe. The '88 New Years showtape, Catch-a-Wave, Mardi Gras City and Little Arrows are such bops! On the CEC side of things, I'm a fan of PTT (although Avenger is nostalgic!), the big bop is Love Makes the World Go Round and my favorites are Crusty, Doli, Artie, Sally, PTT Chuck/Jasper and Rockstar Jasper/Pasqually.
The only location I've been to is {{< wiki-link "Phoenix, AZ (3329 E Bell Rd)" >}} (rip local!). I'm hoping to visit Eagle Rock and Northridge someday and I'd love to go to Volo, Billy Bob's Wonderland, Pineville and State Line! (and Goodyear, which is a much more achievable dream!) ;D
