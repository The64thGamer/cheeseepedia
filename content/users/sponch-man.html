I am the Sponch man. I like the Wolf Pack 5, the Rock-afire Explosion, and suffering over a keyboard while hunting down obscure articles. You know how it is.
Activity may be sporadic. Calculus really wears a Sponch man out, you understand...
Archival work is an obsession of mine. I archive videos and images related to animatronic content. There are other things I archive, of course, but they aren't really related to this topic. As of today, August 24th, 2022, I have archived approximately 42,600 videos. If there's animatronic content you'd like me to archive, please leave a link on my discussion page.
