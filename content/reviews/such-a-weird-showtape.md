While this show originally seemed pretty good back when it was the only circus tape we knew, the latest reveal of the prior Circus Tape now just makes this a bizarre alternative (and not in a good way like Country Klunk)
All the tape does is swap out Tears of a Clown for the prior Beatles White Album segment of the Monkees Medley. Seems to be a random mashup created to pad out the rest of the year until ShowBiz corporate decided to make their own shows by December. Even weirder is this could've been a nice revision to the Circus Tape that kept TOAC in, added back the additional missing tracks Aaron has teased, and maybe some other misc older songs. Instead its just as short and with no good reason to.
