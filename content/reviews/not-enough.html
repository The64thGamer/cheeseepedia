While it is a nice gesture to save each stage type in a mostly even spread across the US and Canada, there isn't much drive to visit these special locations unless you're a local resident. Saving the animatronics is merely a preservation gesture, but no effort is put into making them an attractive offer to visit what can't already be shown from a YouTube video.

If they were properly offered as an attraction to visit, they should've offered to play classic shows- or offer location exclusive performances. An adult wanting to relive the 80's-00's experience will be met with the Cocomelon slop and measley production value of the current shows. None of the classic arcades from those eras show up either, keeping the same generic machines you can find at any local arcade.

But if these were kept for preservation and not a cohesive retro experience, they would be better off in a museum. Museums offer proper restoration, historical info for patrons to learn, and are as a whole an attraction worth visiting. If you're at a legacy store just to look at a piece of history, a children's arcade isn't the best viewing experience, especially one that gives you no context or help as to their relevancy.
