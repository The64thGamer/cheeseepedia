While Country II is already great, this variant cuts down on all the dialogue to hit you with just those outstanding songs, alongside adding three new ones with Shawn Fernandez as a new Klunk voice! It's also neat having the Ricky Scaggs Medley replace Dook with Klunk in the first segment so you get a nice variant for playlists. IMO one of the best song compilation tapes in the whole tape library.

Sad we never got to see more Klunk variant tapes, this rendition of him feels appropriately toned down to match the other characters, which would have been nice to see how they would have interacted in future shows.
