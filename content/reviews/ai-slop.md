A disappointing venture with no soul. The entire building is full of AI Slop and garbage with no creativity, just the brand's IP slapped across random themes relating to 'adventure'. The brand has no artistry or care for making their experience magical, just whatever was the bare minimum to open a restaurant.

The interior isn't much better either, its just one giant mega structure for kids to run in and a smaller area next to the seating. The rest is just seating and some claw machines to continue CEC's trend of child gambling. It looks gaudy and unappealing, it'd be cheaper to buy some Little Ceasers and go to a public park, I garuntee you'd have a more worthwhile time. You'd be touching grass unlike the suits that run this place.
