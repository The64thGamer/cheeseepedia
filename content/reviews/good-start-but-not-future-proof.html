Ah yes, the legendary Winchester Blvd store. The tiny wood panel wonder that changed dining and entertainment forever. While the store is important and has nearly a decade of history leading up to its opening, I don't blame people for moving their attention to Kooser Rd when it opened. I can not imagine this 5,000 square foot building in any other shape besides what  it opened with. The portrait design defiantly feels like a way to save space, keep the ground open for games and seating. It would basically have to be completely gutted to meet any post-merger standards, and mostly likely would have been closed in the 2000's and demolished with the shopping center. 

If this was the 70;s or 80's I'd recommend you still check out the store, but I'm not surprised that basically all info stops after 1979 and the store didn't make it past the merger.

Also on a semi-related note, does it seem odd that we have no family photos or home movies for a store that was reported to have lines out the door after opening? I've never seen any "Remember the chucky cheese in the Town and Country?" posts on Facebook and every visual we have of the store is from ads or news reports...
