My first review of 2026 and what better way to celebrate with a January showtape, the CEC Jan'91 more known as Friends, as its name suggests is a showtape about the friendship with lots of energy and fun, this was the last of many things such like the 'It's Showtime' bumper and the classic Cyberstar intro, with the name Showbiz with a  with a appearance of Billy Bob only for some seconds, the last show of Connie Nelson as Helen Henny, also this features puppets they only appear very little and to be honest I don't like it so much, especially Chuck E. he looks creepy, this was the first time that appear Chuck E's Place a very classic song of Chuck E. Cheese's. The song fits the theme of friends very well, but I prefer the newer versions (especially the January 2004 version).
