Blast From The Past has a fantastic selection of classic song covers from 90s shows, and every character gets a song of their own. The intermissions created for Studio C Premiere being on this show also helps bridge the gap between the 90s and 2000s shows, and it also allows this show to represent several different eras of 90s shows. You get early 90s Scott Wilson shows, 1994 Disney, AAM and early Studio C. The new VJ spots are also fun and remind me of the ones used in the 92-93 shows.
This show does run a little short though at around 50 minutes, especially compared to the previous year's January show which ran for almost two hours. They could've definitely thrown in a few originals, there were several that had not been reused with programming by this point and were due for a return. They also could've thrown in some 91-92 intermissions like Geography Rap or Helen Henny's Hollywood, which would've increased the runtime and added some more variety.
