Overall, I really like this album. Terror Vision did a fantastic job designing and presenting it, and the linear notes give some interesting insight. However, where it lacks is in sound quality (which is probably the most important factor at the end of the day.) Some songs sound great, while others clearly haven't gotten the treatment they deserve. "Too Shy" and "Dreamer" in particular. The latter has multiple odd cuts and is in fake stereo, and to be quite honest, I'm not even sure what happened to "Too Shy." It's a great song, but it sounds borderline unlistenable on this release, especially when compared to something like Gee, Our 1st Album! where it sounds substantially better. There's also some strange and fairly prominent omissions from this release. "Goin' Crazy" and "Strain Your Brain" always spring to mind when I think of original Rock-afire content. But nonetheless, I would still recommend this to any fan of The Rock-afire Explosion. I'm just glad we have a new album released in the 21st century, even if it's a subpar compilation.
