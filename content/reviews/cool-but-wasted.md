When Northridge California, became the first legacy store, It was exciting for everyone to save a 2nd stage, however it was disappointing that they removed the old art. and the stage wasn't in the best condition, at least we had the curtains back!! In 2024 with nanuet it was strange for two reasons, one being phase 5 and two being studio c. They kept the art and the exterior and made changes to the stage, but they DID NOT PROGRAM IT, luckily, Pineville, Hicksville, and Springfield were other legacy stores and were better (especially Pineville). However, people wanted more from these stores and I can understand that, some prototype stages and studio c or the road stage They chose Mississauga, Ontario because of the road stage, being the only legacy store in Canada, but I understand the people who wanted Willowdale (if only for the statue), and I wonder why they couldn't have easily chosen both as well as New York. And I think that since 2024 they could have chosen more instead of three to keep everyone happy, but I'm still glad that we saved 6 stores. We're talking about a company that couldn't have listened to us as always.
