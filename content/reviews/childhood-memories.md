I am fond of the Patchogue location, but like most, it's prime was in the early 2000s. My first time going here was in first grade (2003-2004?) and I saw the Studio C Beta. This was when CEC was known for dim lights and bright, flashy shows. I was enamored by Chuck, TBH.

I used to go a lot. I'm pretty sure up until middle school. And I remember one day I went and the service was just absolutely terrible. So terrible that I wrote a letter to CEC Corporate. And I ended up getting a redeemable card, that I should've kept. Would've been scannable data, but I digress.

I'd say pre-2015 was the best in terms of layout and games. I stopped caring about CEC when they switched to Rockstar, but also grew out of it. But when 2015 hit, they absolutely tore out every game. A whole entire section devoted to kiddie rides. It was just... a bad use of space.

However, I'm surprised to say that the 2.0 remodel really brought some life back to this location. And even restored it to its original layout, with the showroom in the back (though now they had more space to go even further back). I went most recently with my cousin and her kid. The salad bar was perfect!

I'd say that 2.0 revitalized this dying location. Also, I've always wanted to live in the house behind the location. Imagine going to CEC after school every day?
