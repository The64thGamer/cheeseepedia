As a kid, I guess my anxiety manifested as stomach aches, so I saw a gastroenterologist near this location. I liked going because afterwards, my mom would take me to Chuck E. Cheese's. Oh, it was great. And BTW, I was a little bit older too. This was around middle school, when I stopped going to {{wiki-link "Patchogue, NY (121 Sunrise Hwy)" }}. The nice thing about this location is that even with a Studio C Cappa, it was definitely stuck in the late 90s. The rainbow lights, the signage, the carpet, everything.

I also used to go to this location as a kid for birthday parties. I distinctly remember it smelling strongly of cheese, and I remember playing Hungry Hungry Hippos and getting lost in the Skytubes. Fun times.

Anywho, the later days of Commack were worth going to. A smell of fresh pizza always wafted through the location, and it was nice to basically have the whole place to myself. Until it closed :(

And now it's a funeral home???
