Harmony’s Wild West Show is one of my favorite guest star showtapes, it’s one of the first I remember being exposed to, watching the capt. slappy videos on it. It’s the show that first introduces one of my favorite guest characters: Harmony Howlette. The theme of western music I think works really well with the early ptt characters and Harmony butting heads with Chuck instead of just taking his insults is really funny at times. The range of songs works well too, from older western songs with Down Cowboy Memory Lane to the more up beat songs in [insert the segment about rhythm here], it all works well to make each segment feel unique. I have one like teeny tiny gripe with this showtape in that it has a few songs that don’t have Harmony in them, or aren’t supposed to at least. Take Mountain Songs for example, Harmony’s not supposed to be in this showtape and isn’t until she’s name dropped at the very end, but she’s right there on the stage, plus it’s right in the middle of the showtape so it doesn’t really work as a way to “introduce” her if she’s already there. I do get that you’re not supposed to be listening to all of these shows all in a row, and that’s why it’s a tiny gripe, but it is one I have. My favorite segment has to be the Bad Boy Billy segment, it’s all about the aforementioned bandit and how, according to Munch at least, he came and ate Pasqually’s pizza and also made Munch eat some. It’s a pretty fun segment with a nice song too, I probably do have some bias towards it as it was the first ptt video I can remember watching. The birthday segments are, fine I guess. They’re not terrible but they’re nothing to write home about either. The special in this showtape is a Christmas special and it’s pretty good, it’s more of the usual banter if not a bit laid back since it’s a more cheery segment. My final opinion on this show is that it’s a great introduction to the character and in my opinion one of the best guest character showtapes.
