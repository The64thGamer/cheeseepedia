I like the idea of Chuck's Arcade I'm glad it has a theme using ptt chuck is great, It's like Dave and Busters but simple. The problem is how their marketing was "FOR ADULTS". Only the kansas city had food, no beer(for some reason Chuck E Cheese's does) and the animatronics the animatronics been taxidermy feel very desperate but the art in Kansas City is cool, maybe the best location
