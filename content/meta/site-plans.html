For users who don't frequent the Discord Server where most talk happens around the site, here are current plans for the site.

<h2>Photo Gallery Enhancements (ASAP)</h2>
Fix the category that shows all photos to split them into pages, alongside properly sorting them by date.

<h2>The Polls (Mid 2025)</h2>
The success of the {{< wiki-link "Animatronics Fandom Open Census Poll" >}} (not conducted by Cheese-E-Pedia) has led to the idea of having CEP run polls every half year to garner data on the animatronics community, with openly shared results and dedicated pages to graphs of the results over time. Having the polls built into the site will also hopefully catch more submissions than only passing around the link.
<br>
While it would be nice to use the wiki's current editor to simply have users create "pages" that document their choices, this wouldn't allow the polls to be anonymous, and would have less submissions as you need a GitHub account to edit. More research will need to be done on polling plugins (Preferrably not just Google Sheets again) to have it built into the site.

<h2>Switch from Decap CMS to Sveltia CMS (Mid/Late 2025)</h2>
Currently the site's editing system, Decap CMS, sucks really bad but is basically the only option for live editing with moderation tools. There is a fork of it called Sveltia CMS that's just a single link replacement to improve many aspects- but the problem is it currently hasn't implemented "Open Authoring", which allows people to automatically push updates to the site for approval. Their timeline says OA will be implemented after release in early 2025, so it's just a waiting game for when that is done.
<br>
One major flaw of Decap that will handicap moderation speeds is that image uploads are currently broken. Mods have to track down the file on the user's fork and upload it themselves through GitHub. There are also issues with pages having their live preview displayed.

<h2>User Page Upgrades (Unknown Time)</h2>
User pages need better implementation to allow filling out more info. Implementing profile pictures and bios mainly. User-submitted parts of the wiki need to also be applied, such as reviews. Additionally, icons or badges displayed with the user may be implemented denoting their rank by how many contributions they've done.

<h2>Embedded Forum / Comments (Unknown Time)</h2>
Research into embedding comments and forum posts into the site rather than them being hosted seperately. Could be done with Staticman. Other plans are to revive the CEP forum with Discourse at some point as a way to move off of Discord.
