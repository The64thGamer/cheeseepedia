Even though the wiki is now a static site with no accounts or live elements, users and their contributions are still tracked! The <a href="{{< ref "/tags/user/" >}}">Users List</a> is where you can see every user's contribution count and user page link. It is not required to make a user page, but you are free to put whatever you want <sup>within reason</sup> on there if you do. This link will show up anywhere on the site that mentions you.
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First go into the editor, you can just click "Edit Page" up top. (Or open Visual Studio Code if you're doing this locally)</li>
    <li>Open the file menu on the top left and go to the <code>/content/users</code> folder. You should see a list of user .html files.</li>
    <li>Right click the <code>users</code> folder and hit "Add New File". Name it to <code>yourusername.html</code>.</li>
    <li>Next, add this into the file as the parameters.
        <pre><code>

draft = false

+++</code></pre></li>
    <li>Set <code>title</code> to be your username you use across the site. This is case-sensitive so make sure it's consistent! Keep <code>draft</code> and <code>tags</code> the same as they are, and set <code>date</code> updated to today's date any time you change the article. The date is formatted like <code>startDate = "2024-12-31"</code></li>
    <li>Anything below the <code>+++</code> is free for you to write. Introduce yourself and such! After that you're basically done, commit the changes and pull request to the site.</li>
    <li>Once your user page is up it will also auto-populate with a link to every article you've contributed to. Over time more automated lists may show up on your page.</li>
</ul>
