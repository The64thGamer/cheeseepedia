## Writing Guidelines

Follow these rules for submissions or they will not be accepted.

- Mark references and citations for any info. If you source was "I saw it", provide photo or video proof as the source. If your source was "I heard it from an employee/manager", provide proof as the source, or at the very least note this interaction as a citation so it can be independently verified.
- Keep articles well written and without excessive grammar issues.
- Keep writing academic, avoid use of opinions- whether your own or "community concensus".
- No uploading of [}}">Creative Engineering Premium Service](%7B%7B%3C%20ref%20){wiki="" creative="" engineering="" premium="" video="" service"=""} videos or screenshots. Documenting info on them is fine.
- No leaking of private company or employee info.
- Every page should start off with the page's name in
  *bold italics.* The first sentence should give a brief description of the item, and the years it was used in. After this single sentence a new paragraph must be started if more details are to be described. Only a single paragraph at maximum should be at the top of a page, anything further should then be separated by a header.
- All things dealing with Creative Engineering should be labeled as by Creative Engineering, not Aaron Fechter. Despite Aaron being the sole employee of Creative Engineering to current day, things could change in the future, whether he brings on new official employees, or gives up the brand to a new owner. It is best to keep the formatting consistent, and have anything Fechter has made be listed as 'by Creative Engineering'. The same applies to the names of brands based on their time period. CEC Entertainment Corp was once ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., which was also once separately ShowBiz Pizza Inc. and Pizza Time Theatre Inc.. Creative Engineering is also notably separate from ShowBiz Pizza Place, as they were a licensee, not a subsidiary.
- Pictures should attempt to blur faces of customers and guests where possible without blurring any possibly important details around them. Its not strictly prohibited to upload unblurred photos, but it is encouraged they be blurred- and to update other photos to include blurring later on.
- The wiki seperates articles as the "Pizza Time Theatre" category for anything from 1977-1984, and "Chuck E. Cheese's" for anything from 1985 to the present, and your articles should follow that. There are many complicated factors as to what things should refer to that name at that time, but we have settled on this simple distinction to ease search of articles about the pre-ShowBiz and post-ShowBiz company.
- The wiki does not focus on fan content, as there are many problems with deciding what is relevant, and the amount of fan content out there would get unwieldy to document. There are exceptions however, in which fan-content is officially acted upon by a company- whether in a good or bad way. One example are simulators, where there are many fan mods and projects available, but only a select few that either got official approval or were officially removed from the internet. Being slightly related this also applies to court cases, whether filed at the company- or the company filing it at an individual or other entity.
