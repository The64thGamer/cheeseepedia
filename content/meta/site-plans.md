For users who don't frequent the Discord Server where most talk happens around the site, here are current plans for the site.

## Photo Gallery Enhancements (ASAP)

Fix the category that shows all photos to split them into pages, alongside properly sorting them by date.

## Switch from Decap CMS to Sveltia CMS (2026)

Currently the site's editing system, Decap CMS, sucks really bad but is basically the only option for live editing with moderation tools. There is a fork of it called Sveltia CMS that's just a single link replacement to improve many aspects- but the problem is it currently hasn't implemented "Open Authoring", which allows people to automatically push updates to the site for approval. Their timeline says OA will be implemented after release in 2026, so it's just a waiting game for when that is done.
One major flaw of Decap that will handicap moderation speeds is that image uploads are currently broken. Mods have to track down the file on the user's fork and upload it themselves through GitHub. There are also issues with pages having their live preview displayed.

## User Page Upgrades (Unknown Time)

User pages need better implementation to allow filling out more info. Implementing profile pictures and bios mainly. User-submitted parts of the wiki need to also be applied, such as reviews. Additionally, icons or badges displayed with the user may be implemented denoting their rank by how many contributions they've done.

## Embedded Forum / Comments (Unknown Time)

Research into embedding comments and forum posts into the site rather than them being hosted seperately. Could be done with Staticman. Other plans are to revive the CEP forum with Discourse at some point as a way to move off of Discord.
