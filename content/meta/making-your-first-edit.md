Thanks for wanting to contribute to Cheese-E-Pedia! Thankfully this process is easy for any article. For this first example let's just assume you're wanting to do some quick grammar edits to a page and submit your results, here's how:

- First, find the article you want to edit and hit the "Edit Page" button on the top right. You can use this article as an example.
- This will prompt you to create a GitHub account through Decap CMS, which we use to run the built-in editor. Create the account and log in through the Decap CMS page to give it authorization.
- Articles are displayed with a list of options, alongside the main article body- which is written in HTML formatting like all web pages.
- Go ahead and begin making your edits to the article. Some quick formatting notes: `<b></b>` for **bold**, `<i></i>` for *italics*, `<h2></h2>` for article headings. Places like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) provide all the info you'll need for lists, tables, ect. You can also browse other article's files to see how they do things.

## Before you submit!

- First thing you wanna do add your username to the contributors list! This is one of the options listed above the article body. This puts you on the contributors list at the bottom of the live page, and also tracks your contribution count in the users list accesible from Contributor Home or the homepage! Be sure to keep your name consistent across article edits! Also don't use quotes or backslashes in your name or it'll break things.

## Submitting

- When you're ready to save, you can click the icon marked "Save" to submit your changes.

## I submitted! Now what?

- Your edit is now in the review process by the mod team. When we have the time we'll go over your edits and ensure they meet wiki standards and won't break anything. This is done over on the {{< github-repository >}} in the "Pull Requests" section. We may leave a comment on the edit asking for more info or letting you know to change something before it's merged, so check on your contributions or set up email notifications!
- Once your edit is approved, it'll be added to the site. The site automatically updates when any changes are merged, but this can take between 5 and 10 minutes to appear on the live site.

And that's it! For more complex article editing such as tags, categories, parameters, image insertions, creating new pages, ect, check the rest of the tutorials!
