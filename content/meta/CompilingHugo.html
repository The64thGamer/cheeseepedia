Working on Cheese-E-Pedia directly through GitHub can be slow and with limitations. The proper way for managing lots of contributions is to create a local instance on your computer linked through Github Desktop.
<br>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A live editor to preview any changes you make to articles or the site itself.</li>
    <li>Find and replace option across the website, for instance instantly erasing all mentions of "Phase 4".</li>
    <li>Fully working offline copy you can read and edit without internet.</li>
    <li>Syntax coloring and other Visual Studio Code extensions available</li>
    <li>Preview all changes you've made in Github Desktop. This also allows undoing entire files, or splitting changes into different commits</li>
</ul>
<br>
You will need just 3 things for this process: Visual Studio Code, Hugo, and GitHub Desktop. This process should only take 10 minutes.
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The repository is not the Cheese-E-Pedia website itself, rather a collection of files that will be compiled into a static site. First download the repository from the {{< github-repository >}}.</li>
    <li>It is reccomended to fork the site and have <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">GitHub Desktop</a> download the project to your computer, that way any changes can be pushed as Pull Requests to this repository for inclusion.</li>
    <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.92.2">Hugo v0.92.2+extended</a> which is the compiler for the site.</li>
    <li>Download Visual Studio Code from your store of choice. Go to <code>File>Open Folder</code> and open the <code>Cheeseepedia</code> folder.</li>
    <li>Click on the bottom of Visual Studio Code where the <code>⨂ 0 ⚠ 0</code> text is. This will open a new section.</li>
    <li>On the tabs at the top of the section, click the <code>Terminal</code> window.</li>
    <li>To preview the site, type <code>hugo server</code> and let it compile. It will provide a link to a local port to open in your browser. Any changes you make to the files in Visual Studio Code will now auto-update the site (not always though).</li>
    <li>To close out of the preview, hit <code>Ctrl + C</code> in the terminal.</li>
    <li>To compile the site for rehosting somewhere else, or to have a permanent compilation to use in the browser, just type <code>hugo</code>. The site will be compiled to the <code>/public/</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
