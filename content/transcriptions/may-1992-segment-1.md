**Pasqually:(Singing)** 

In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight. 

In the jungle, the quiet jungle the lion sleeps tonight. 

In the village, the peaceful village the lion sleeps tonight. 

In the village, the quiet village the lion sleeps tonight. 

You know Chuck E., I think I’m gonna let sleeping lions lie

**Mr. Munch:** 

I wonder if it ever wakes up in enough time to eat

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Yeah, and that's one kitty whose bite is bigger than my bark

**Pasqually:** 

I think he’s right

**Mr. Munch:** 

You know, I once had a friend who lived in the same house as a lion

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Wow, wouldn’t that get awfully crowded?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Well, it’s all one world, isn’t it?

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Here’s a little topic I shouldn’t let slip by. 

It has to do with cleaning up the earth, the sea, and the sky. 

Well now is the time we should begin 

and here are some ways that we can all pitch in. 

The rainforest gives the earth its oxygen 

and we’ve got to work together to build them up again. 

We can work together if you please 

cause we got to protect those plants and trees. 

All the little creatures in the deep blue sea, 

I know they may not lie to you and me. 

Rivers and the oceans, we just got to keep em clean. 

We’ve got to keep that water fresh if you know what I mean

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:(Singing)** 

One world is enough for all of us

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

One world is enough

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:(Singing)** 

One world is enough for all of us

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

One world is enough. 

There are some words that I should probably say here 

like we’ve got to protect that ozone layer.

**Pasqually:** 

That’s right

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

It is what protects us from the rays of the sun and without it, well, we’d all be pretty well
done

**Pasqually:** 

Mmm

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

The good news is is it’s so easy to clean up the environment for you and me, see? 

There is still some time to make a stand, put our hands together and devise a plan

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:(Singing)** 

One world is enough for all of us

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

One world is enough

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:(Singing)** 

One world is enough for all of us

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

One world is enough

**Mr. Munch:** 

Well I know what I’m gonna do for the environment. I’m gonna recycle all my cans

**Jasper T. Jowls:** (simultaneously) 

Alright

**Mr. Munch:** 

What about you, Pasqually?

**Pasqually:** 

That’s a good idea. I’m gonna turn off the water before I brush my teeth

**Mr. Munch:** 

That’s good too

**Jasper T. Jowls:** (simultaneously) 

Yeah

**Mr. Munch:** 

Jasper, what about you?

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

I’m gonna gather up all my newspapers and take em down to the recycling center

**Pasqually:** 

Good idea

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:(Singing)** 

One world is enough for all of us

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

One world is enough

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:(Singing)** 

One world is enough for all of us

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

One world is enough

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Stay with us, we’ll be right back
