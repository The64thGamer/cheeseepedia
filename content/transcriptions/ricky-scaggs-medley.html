<b>[Song: Heartbroke]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Uncle Klunk: (singing)</b>
<br>
Well, who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes? 
<br>
Or the bitter direction of impending goodbyes? 
<br>
I'm fallin', I'm folded, I'm welded in place, 
<br>
At the sight of you standin' with streaks down your face. 
<br>
You got your-

<br>
Well, cryin' when you're rich is a poor if you're lonely, 
<br>
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield. 
<br>
But all is not lost, it is only mistaken. 
<br>
A small consolation but I know just how you feel. 
<br>
You got your-

<b>[Song: You've Got a Lover]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
The clubs are all closed and there's no where to go
<br>
When the sun wont show for hours
<br>
The streets have all emptied and lovers lay sleeping
<br>
And dreaming of each other.
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
You've got a lover but it's not me.
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
He can't love you like I can
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
There may be others yes I understand
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
Will they love me-
<br>
Like you can.
<br>
There's acres and acres of heartbroken lovers
<br>
I know we're not the first ones
<br>
But sometimes it seems that it's just like a dream
<br>
That you try hard to remember.
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
You've got a lover but it's not me.
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
He can't love you like I can
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
There may be others yes I understand
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
But will they love me-
<br>
Like you can.

<b>[Song: Highway 40 Blues]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Fatz: (singing)</b>
<br>
These Highway 40 blues
<br>
I've walked holes in both my shoes
<br>
Counted the days since I've been gone
<br>
Well I'd like to see the lights of home
<br>
I've wasted time and money too
<br>
Squandered years in search of truth
<br>
In the end I had to lose
<br>
Lord about to pay my dues
<br>
Got them Highway 40 blues
<br>
Highway called when I was young
<br>
Told me lies of things to come
<br>
Fame and fortune lies ahead
<br>
That's what the billboard lights had said
<br>
Shattered dreams my mind is numb
<br>
Money's gone stick out my thumb
<br>
Eyes are filled with bitter tears
<br>
Lord I ain't been home in years
<br>
Got them Highway 40 blues
<br>
You know I've traveled all around
<br>
Rolling stone from town to town
<br>
Met pretty girls I have to say
<br>
None of them could make me stay
<br>
Well I've played the music halls and bars
<br>
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
<br>
Things a country boy can't use 
<br>
Dixieland, I sure miss you
<br>
Got them Highway 40 blues
