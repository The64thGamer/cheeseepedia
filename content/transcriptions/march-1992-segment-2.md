Carry the torch that's being passed to you

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

The vision's wide open, do what you have to do

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)** 

Though it may all seem uphill you can make it if you only will. 

Stand proud and tall, give it your best. 

Even birds fall when they first leave the nest. 

Learn how to walk before you can run. 

As hard as it seems don't ever give up on your dreams

**Pasqually: (Singing)** 

Like those before in valor and competition

**Helen Henny: (Singing)** 

Champions march on in honor and tradition

Learn how to walk before you can run. 

As hard as it seems don't ever give up on your dreams. 

Don’t ever give up

Though it may all seem uphill you can make it if you only will. 

Stand proud and tall give it your best
