**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Quiet on the set! Quiet on the set!

**[Sounds of Shh-ing]**

**[Song:Honky Tonkin’]**

**All: (Singing)**

And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'

Honky tonkin', honey baby

We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Alright folks, here she comes.

**Mr. Munch:**

The cowgirl who gathers more posses than Jesse James, Harmony Howlette! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yahoo! 

**Chuck E. Chuck:**

And you’re gonna take us Honky Tonkin ain’t that right Harmony? 

**Harmony Howlette:**

That’s right Big C so hit it Pasqually

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go, 

come to see me baby and bring along some dough. 

**All: (Singing)**

And we’ll go Honky Tonkin, Honky Tonkin

Honky Tonkin honey baby

We’ll go Honky Tonkin round this town

**Pasqually:**

Eh boss, how'd I do? 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey Pasqually, you couldn’t carry a tune if it had handles on it. 

**Pasqually:**

That a- does it boss, arrivederci.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Pasqually don’t go away mad, I wanna forget you just the way you are. 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

When you and your baby have a fallin' out

Call me up, sweet mama, and we'll go steppin' out

**All: (Singing)**

And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'

Honky tonkin', honey baby

We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

**[Song: If You’ve Got the Money, Honey]**

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

We'll go honky tonkin' babe and have us a time

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

We'll have more fun, baby, on the way down the line

If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

**Harmony Howlette:**

You know fellas, that Big C, he’s as tight with his compliments as he is with his money! 

**Mr. Munch, Jasper T. Jowls, & Pasqually:**

That’s for sure! 

**Harmony Howlette:**

I mean if he gives you a pat on the back it’s only to see what he can get you to cough up! Haha! 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Now you bring the money baby, you know I never mind 

Bring along your Cadillac, leave my wreck behind

We’ll go honky tonkin’ baby and I won’t spend a dime 

So if you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

**All except Chuck: (Singing)**

If you’ve got the money, honey, I’ve got the time

**Harmony Howlette:**

Well boys with the money Big C pays me, we’re not gonna get much honky tonkin’ in. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You know Harmony I resemble that statement very much, especially since I was just gonna pay you a large compliment! 

**Harmony Howlette:**

I don’t believe that anymore than I believe you’re gonna give me a raise. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

I was just about to say that you’re one performer whose career bears a lot of watching.

**Harmony Howlette:**

Why thank you so much Big C! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Course then I was gonna say it’s too bad it ain’t worth listening to. 

**[Song:Take Me Back to Tulsa]**

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Where's that gal with the red dress on? 

Some folks called her Dinah

Stole her heart away from me, 

way down in Louisiana

**All but Chuck: (Singing)**

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

The Little bee sucks the blossom, the big bee gets the honey

Little man makes the pizza, the big rat takes the money!

**Harmony Howlette:**

Listening Big C?

**All but Chuck: (Singing)**

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

**Jasper T. Jowl: (Singing)**

I always wear a great big smile, some folks think it’s funny

Travel all over the country, Big C takes the money! 

**All but Chuck: (Singing)**

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

**Harmony Howlette: (Singing)**

I went down to Tulsa, that was my undoing 

Started into singing, still can hear the booing

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh no! 

**All but Chuck: (Singing)**

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry

**Mr. Munch:**

Yeehaw!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yippee! Haha hahaha haha! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well folks, we certainly hoped you enjoyed the show. This is Chuck E. Cheese, The Big C, saying: After all I do for these people, you think I’d get a little respect! Jeez!
