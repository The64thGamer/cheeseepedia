This is CBS. 

**Jefferey:**

Why my mom should take me to Chuck E. Cheese. By Jefferey Allen Adams. It’s because I have been good at school and home and I have not pickled fights with my sister. 

**[Sister shoves Jefferey slightly]**

**Jefferey:**

Very much. 

**Kids: (Singing)**

Hey little brother, come and have a ball

At Chuck E. Cheese, you’ll be walking tall

You can laugh, be a kid

You can flip your lid! 

Chuck E. Cheese

Where a kid, can be a kid!

**Jefferey:**

Thanks ma.
