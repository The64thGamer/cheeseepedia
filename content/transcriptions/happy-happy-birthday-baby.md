**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Hey Bic C, I heard we were gonna celebrate somebody’s birthday.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That’s right Jasper, they’re right out there.

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Well I think I’ll sing them a birthday song!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Go for it Jasper.

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Happy, happy birthday baby

Although you’re with somebody new

Thought I’d drop a line to say, that I wish this happy day

Would find me beside you

Happy, happy birthday baby

No I can’t call you my baby

Seems like years ago we met, on a day I can’t forget

Cuz that’s when we fell in love

**Warblettes: (Singing)**

Do you remember?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

How could I ever forget?

**Warblettes: (Singing)**

The names we had for each other.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Darlin, I- I called you teddy bear I’m sure I did.

**Warblettes: (Singing)**

I was your pretty

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Pretty? Honey, you're beautiful.

**Warblettes: (Singing)**

I was your baby

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

I love you.

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn’t spoil your birthday

Though I’m acting like a baby

So I’ll close this note to you, with good luck and wishes too

Happy, happy birthday baby

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Happy birthday friend. 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

And come back on your next birthday so I can sing again!
