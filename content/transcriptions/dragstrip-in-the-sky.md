**The Wolfman:**
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good sound hound! But now let’s introduce our female vocalist. A sad tale of love and honor with the crimson fox and her bobby socks, I present Little Queenie!

**Little Queenie: (Singing)**

My girlfriends told me he’s no good

He’ll hurt you one day

I never really understood 

Till the dragstrip took him away

Foxy was my boyfriend

so slick, so sharp, so cool 

His hot rod was his toy, friend 

Till they challenged him to a duel

He took his car down to the dragstrip

The foxes all were there

The other gang, The Wolfpack

And made him take the dare

The cars took off with squealing rubber

In a fiery cloud of smoke

Foxy would have been the winner 

Till his rear end axel broke

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

My Foxy’s gone away from me

I never said goodbye

But he’ll be safe and sound you see

In that dragstrip 

In 

The 

Sky! 

In the sky
