<b>[Song: Going Downhill]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Fatz: (singing)</b>
<br>
It all started at the corner table
<br>
Sippin' on a Jack and Coke
<br>
By the end of the evenin'
<br>
We were actin' like married folk
<br>
The weekend weakened me and took me of my will
<br>
You got me-
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
Ahh~

<b>Fatz: (singing)</b>
<br>
A goin' downhill
<br>
Goin' downhill
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
Goin' downhill
<br><br>
<b>Fatz: (singing)</b>
<br>
Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you
<br>
I-I-I've spent all my money
<br>
I have lost my respect
<br>
Y-you got me walkin' in circles, honey
<br>
I- I'm a- I'm a nervous wreck
<br>
Lord, one step ahead of a welfare dollar bill
<br>
You got me-

Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you
<br><br>
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I think about you
<br>
From daylight to dawn
<br>
I bet I won't weigh 15 pounds
<br>
A'when they drag my body home
<br>
Like a junkie hooked on dope

I'm hooked on your thrill
