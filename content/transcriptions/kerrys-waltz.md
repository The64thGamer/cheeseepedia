**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

I Loved you, before I knew you

Before you knew you

Even before you was born

I knew you'd be beautiful

I prayed you'd be kind to me

But sugarbear I'd never dreamed

And it never seemed

That I'd find you and love you until....

**All: (Singing)**

You came into my life

And you danced, with me


**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

I can't believe that you're here in my arms

Giving your love, sharing your charms

You know, You knew when i said hello

Darling I didn't know

The secrets you're saving for me, only me

**All: (Singing)**

We knew she'd be beautiful

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

I just didn't know you'd want me for your plan

**All: (Singing)**

We knew she'd be kind to me

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

You had a funny little plan

mu- mu- mu- mu- mu- mu- 

My happy feet, move to the beat 

of the music I'd forgotten until......

**All: (Singing)**

You came into my life

And you danced

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

And you danced

**All: (Singing)**

With me

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

And you danced

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

I can't believe that you're here in my arms

Giving your love, sharing your charms

I love you, I love you

My dear Kerry

My dear Kerry
