**Boy:**

I just want to say that I am tired and tired of dumb old restaurants.

**Young girl:**

I agree!

**Young boy:**

We gotta sit still and not run around. 

**Girl:**

And do you know what else? They make you eat stuff like linguine! 

**All:**

Ew! 

**All: (Singing)**

But at Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s you can act like a kid

You can have more fun than you ever did

You can giggle  

You can wiggle 

You can flip your lid!

Chuck E. Cheese

Where a kid, can be a kid!
