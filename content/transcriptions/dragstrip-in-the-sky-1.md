**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's our very own beach bear pouring out yet another one of his sensitive love ballads, straight from that golden heart of his. And now, a truely unique entertainer. Yes ladies and gentlemen, a singer among singers, an artist among artists, a performer among performers, ladies and gentlemen I'm talking about an entertainer among entertainers. And without further ado I present to you an entertainer who needs no introduction, and- do you have anything to add to that little Earle?

**Earle Schmerle:**

Uh- naw. 

**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

Ok, well then- 

**Earle Schmerle:**

That about says it all. 

**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

Ok, then- then let's present: Mitzi Mozarella! 

**[Song starts]**

**Earle Schmerle:**

Wait! Did you say she was a singer among singers?

**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

Yes I did Earle. 

**Earle Schmerle:**

Well, did you say she was a muiscian among musicians?

**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

Uh- gee I don't remember Earle.

**Earle Schmerle:**

Well did you say her mother drives a Lincoln Continental? 

**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

No Earle, I didn't say that. 

**Earle Schmerle:**

Well you gotta say that!

**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

My girlfriends told me he’s no good

He’ll hurt you one day

I never really understood 

Till the dragstrip took him away

Mickey was my boyfriend

so slick, so sharp, so cool 

His hot rod was his toy, friend 

Till they challenged him to a duel

He took his car down to the dragstrip

The other gang was there

They call themselves the Egg Crates

And made him take the dare

The cars took off with burning rubber

In a fiery cloud of smoke

Mickey would have been the winner 

Till his rear end axel broke

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Now Mickey’s gone away from me

He never said goodbye

But he’ll be safe and sound you see

In that dragstrip 

In 

The 

Sky! 

In the sky
