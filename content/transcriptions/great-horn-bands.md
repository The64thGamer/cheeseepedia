**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ok gang I’m gonna try again with you guys. The time is 1968 and the name is BS&T.

**Mr. Munch:**

Don’t lay anymore of those coded things on us man!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Haha! That’s an easy one, it stands for bacon, sardine, and tomato sandwich!

**Helen Henny:**

Bkaw! Yucky.

**Chuck E Cheese:**

No no no Jasper, it stands for Blood, Sweat, and Tears! The rock band with all the horns.

**All:**

Oh

**[Song: Spinning Wheel]**

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

What goes up, must come down

Spinning wheel, got to go round

Talk about your troubles, it’s a crying sin

Ride a painted pony, let the spinning wheel spin

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Folks, Chuck E’s Bandstand is going to spin a few tunes from the days of the great horn bands like BS&T and Chicago.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

I thought Chicago was a town?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It is, and the band’s real name is The Chicago Transit Authority.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Haha! Chuck E, that’s a bus company!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You’re a very interesting dog Jasper. 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Well thank you Big C, I’m pretty interested in you too. Haha!

**[Song: Make me Smile]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I’m so happy, I’m so happy

To have you love me, yeah!

Life is lovely, ohh

When you’re near me

Tell me you will stay and make me 

Smile

**Helen Henny:** 

I like smiling!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s a great hobby! It’s the only thing to wear on your face

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

And that’s a cue folks! This one’s from Earth, Wind, and Fire!

**Helen Henny:**

Oh

**[Song: Faces]**

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Many faces listen to the sound

Different places, span the globe around

Finding traces true in everyone

No there's nothing new, under the sun

**Pasqually:**

Wow I’m like turned on to this stuff, this makes me happy!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That’s the name of the game, right gang?

**[Everyone agreeing]**

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

I've lost at love before

got mad and closed the door

but you said try, just once more

I chose you for the one

you treated me so kind

I'm about to blow my mind

**All: (Singing)**

You make me so very happy

I’m so glad you, came into my life

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Came into my life!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well folks with a little help from the sound of the 60’s maybe we made your stay here at pizza time theatre a little happier, and if you munch on your pizza for a while we’ll be back with lots more. Don’t touch that dial!

**Warblettes: (Singing)**
