**Mr.Munch: ( talking**)
The band would now like to perform a very special number to some very special people, our mom's.

**Everyone: (singing) 
M is for the millions things she gave me.
O means only that she's growing old.
T is for the tears she shed to save me.
H is for heart of purest gold.
E is for her eyes that love light shinging.
R is right and right she'll always be.
P.
ut them altogether and they special mother.
A word that means a world to me.
**Pasqually : (singing)
M is for the millions things she gave me.
O means that she's growing old.
T is for the tears she shed to save me.
H is for heart of purest gold.
E is for her eyes love light shinging.
R is right and right she'll always be.
You put them all together and they spell mother 
**Everyone: ( singing)**
A word that means a world to me.a
