**Billy Bob:**

Y'know folks? Millions of children already know who we are, cuz we've been playing and singing our songs for years in hundreds of family restaurants all around the country. Isn't that right Little Billy Bob?

**Little Billy Bob:**

That's right big Billy Bob! And now through the miracle of miniaturization and computer electronics, and a few other miracles I can't even begin to pronounce, well now we can go home with the kids and sing em' songs and tell em' stories and- and teach em' things too! So uh, we're really looking forward to it, and rocking and rollin' too!

**Billy Bob:**

Yeah!

**Little Billy Bob & Billy Bob: (Singing)**

Roll over Beethoven

Roll over Beethoven 

Roll over Beethoven
 
Roll over Beethoven

Roll over Beethoven
