<b>Announcer:</b>
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen.
<br>
Only once in a lifetime does a man come along with such unquestionable talent and persistence- that he cannot be denied.
<br>
People, I'd like you to give a warm welcome- a warm ShowBiz welcome, to your favorite rockabilly relative.
<br>
Uncle Klunk.

<b>[Song: Better All Over]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Uncle Klunk: (singing)</b>
<br>
Fell better all Over
<br>
More than anywhere else, baby
<br>
When I'm around you
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
When you kiss me like you do
<br>
Well am as wild as a buck
<br>
Everytime you call me up
<br>
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
That's exactly how I feel
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else when you
<br>
Anytime you're near
<br>
Well my heart beats double time
<br>
When you hold your hand in mine
<br>
You sure is a wonderful deal
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
That's exactly how I feel
<br><br>
<b>[Guitar solo]</b>
<br><br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
When you hold me in your arms
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
When you thrill me with your charms
<br>
Well I di-ji-di-ji-diddle
<br>
I'm as fit as a fiddle
<br>
You makes me wanna kick up my heels
<br>
Well I feel better all over
<br>
More than anywhere else
<br>
That's exactly how I feel
<br>
Well that's exactly how I feel
<br>
Well that's exactly how I feel
<br>
