**Narrator:**

Spanning the globe. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hold it Munch, he said spanning the globe not fanning the globe. 

**[Munch laughs]**

**Narrator:**

It’s time for the Chuck E. Cheese news!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well hello news watchers! Y’know before we start today I wanted to answer a question that lots of you have been asking. “Chuck E” you ask, “Why are you doing a news show on tv?”. Well the answers simple, see I used to be an old newspaper man. But it wasn’t working out you see, I just can’t make any money selling old newspapers. 

**[Newspapers crash as they land on the floor]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And now let us go directly to this special live story from Helen Henny on “Hen on The Street”.

**[Scene shifts to Helen standing on the street]**

**Helen Henny:**

Thank you Chuck E! The news here on the street is that it would be much safer to be on the sidewalk! Oh, you boys and girls should especially remember these rules about the streets: never go into the street chasing a toy or pet, always remember to stop look and listen for cars, only cross streets at the corners, and if there’s not a stop light that tells you when to cross, make sure you have a grown up help you! This is Helen Henny, your “Hen on The Street”, getting off the street right now, woah! 

**[Scene shifts back to Chuck]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thanks for that important story Helen. That’s good advice for all of us. And now let’s hear from sports hound Jasper T. Jowls for some up to the minute scores!

**[Scene shifts to Jasper in front of the ski ball machines]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Thanks Chuck E! And let me check on the latest scores. Let’s see, over there at the ski ball little Jesse just got 150 points! Sarah got 90. And Carter winds up for his pitch and, whoops! The ski ball is heading for the salad bar! Meanwhile over there at the whack-a-mole game, Rashad came back from a disappointing no hitter and scored a personal best of 9 whacked moles, wow! And those are the latest scores! 

**[Scene shifts back to Chuck]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thanks Jasper, and that’s it for now folks! So until later, this is Chuck E. Cheese saying: that’s if something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to me!
