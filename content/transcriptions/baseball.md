**[Sounds of a door slamming and someone walking, offstage]**

**Stage Manager:**

Hey Billy Bob, you're on!

**Billy Bob:**

I'm on?

**Stage Manager:**

Yeah. 

**[The sounds of footsteps get louder as Billy Bob rushes to the stage, cutain opens]**

**Billy Bob:**

Here's a song for all my teachers! 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

I like to play baseball

I like to go swimming 

We like to go to movies 

**Looney Bird: (Singing)**

With pretty women! 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

We like to eat pizza

**Billy Bob & Looney Bird: (Singing)**

Play Pac-Man too! 

But we don't like to 

Paint the house 

Scrub the floor

Do you? 

We like to have lots of fun 

and sing these songs for you 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

We like to play records

**Looney Bird: (Singing)**

And ride in a limo 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

We like to go bowling 

**Looney Bird: (Singing)**

With fine young women! 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

We love Paul McCartney 

**Billy Bob & Looney Bird: (Singing)**

And Disney too! 

But we don't like to 

Mow the lawn 

Rake the leaves 

Do you? 

We like to have lots of fun

and sing these songs for you 

We like to turn on 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

With love for this world

**Billy Bob & Looney Bird: (Singing)**

We like short dresses 

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

When they're on girls, hehe! 

**Billy Bob & Looney Bird: (Singing)**

We like to vote yes

To solar power! 

But we don't like to study much

Arithmatic makes us sick 

We like to have lots of fun

And sing these songs for you!
