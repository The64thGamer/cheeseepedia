**[Song: You Never Give Me Your Money.]**

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

You never give me your money

You only give me your funny paper

And in the middle of negotiations

You break down

**Billy Bob & Looney Bird: (Singing)**

I never give you my number

I only give you my situation

And in the middle of investigation

I break down

**Fatz: (Singing)**

Out of college, money spent

See no future, pay no rent

All the money's gone, nowhere to go

Any jobber got the sack

Monday morning, turning back

Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

Oh, that magic feeling

Nowhere to go

Oh, that magic feeling

Nowhere to go

Nowhere to go

**All: (Singing)**

Ah, ah, Oo

Ah, ah, Oo

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

One sweet dream

Pick up the bags, get in the limousine

Soon we'll be away from here

Step on the gas and wipe that tear away

One sweet dream came true today

Came true today

Came true today, yes, it did

**All: (Singing)**

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

All good children go to heaven

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

All good children go to heaven

**[Song: Sun King.]**

**All: (Singing)**

Ooh, here comes the sun king

Here comes the sun king

**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

Everybody’s laughing

Everybody’s happy

**All: (Singing)**

Here comes the sun king

Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón

Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel 

**[Song: Mean Mr. Mustard]**

**Earl: (Singing)**

Mean Mr. Mustard lives in the park

Shaves in the dark

Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road

Saving up to buy him some clothes

Keeps a ten bob note up his nose

Such a mean old man

Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop

She never stops 

She's a go getter

Takes him out to look at the queen

Always shouts out something obscene

Such a dirty old man

Dirty old man

**[Song: Polythene Pam]**

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

You should see Polythene Pam

She's not good-looking, but she looks like a man

Well you should see her in drag, dressed in a polythene bag

Yes, you should see Polythene Pam

**All: (Singing)**

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

**[Song: She Came In Through The Bathroom Window.]**

**Off stage voice:**

Oh, look out!

**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

I came in through the bathroom window

Protected by a silver spoon

But now I suck my thumb and wonder

By the banks of my own lagoon

**All: (Singing)**

Didn't anybody tell her?

Didn't anybody see?

Sunday's on the phone to Monday

Tuesday's on the phone to me

**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

And so I quit the police department

Got myself a steady job

And though she tried her best to help me

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

She could steal, but she could not rob

**All: (Singing)**

Didn't anybody tell her?

Didn't anybody see?

Sunday's on the phone to Monday

Tuesday's on the phone to me

Oh yeah

**[Song: Golden Slumbers.]**

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

Once there was a way

To get back homeward

Once there was a way

To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry

And I will sing a lullaby

**Moon: (Singing)**

Golden slumbers fill your eyes

Smiles await you when you rise

Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

And I will sing a lullaby

**[Song: Carry That Weight.]**

**All: (Singing)**

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Carry that weight a long time

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow

I only send you my invitations

And in the middle of the celebrations, I break down

**Off Stage voice:**
Sing it, ya natey!

**All: (Singing)**

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Carry that weight a long time

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Carry that weight a long time

**[Song: The End.]**

**Moon: (Singing)**

Oh yeah

Alright

Are you going to be in my dreams

Tonight

**All: (Singing)**

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

Love you 

**Fatz Geronimo: (Singing)**

Folks

**All: (Singing)**

And in the end

The love you take

Is equal to the love you make
