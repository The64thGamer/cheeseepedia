**[Song: Color's] ** 
**Chuck E: (Singing)
If I Had to Choose
One Color Over the Other's 
That I Couldn't Do 
Cause It Wouldn't Work Out
I Know That Everything I See
Has A Different Color Scheme 
It Blend's Systemically to Paint a Picture 
Living In a Beautiful World 
**Everyone (Singing)**
Full Of Color's 
**Chuck E: (Singing)**
There's One for Every Boy and Girl 
**Everyone: (Singing)
Sister's And Brother's 
**Chuck E: (Singing)**
If I Had to Pick My Favorite One It Be Every Color Underneath the Sun 
Favorite Color's 
Every Single One of Them
**Chuck E: (Singing)**
Red, Yellow & Blue
Lavender Or a Deep Maroon
Were The Shade or Hue 
I Just Can't Leave One Out 
I Know That Everything That I See
Has Different Color Scheme 
It Blend's Systemically to Paint a Picture   
They Are 
Living In a Beautiful World
