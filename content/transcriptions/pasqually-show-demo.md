**[Gunshots & Car Horns]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Okay everybody, I-I think I see Pasqually coming now! Yeah there he is, he's coming around the corner- now he's passing a truck on the left. Now he's passing a red light! Now- he's pulling into the parking lot. He's getting out of the car. I can see he's racing in the back door-

**[Gigantic Crash With Pots & Pans]**

There he is now.

**Pasqually:**

Mama mia.

**[Musical Sting]**

Che cosa fai? Questa mattina non va bene! (What are you doing? This morning is not good!)

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey what's the matter Pasqually? Did you get your spaghetti in a twist?

**[Chuck Laughs]**

**[Song: Funiculi, Funicula (Italia Mia - Mantovani)]**

**Pasqually: (singing)**

Halaaah

You know I'm here to make-a-da pizza

'Cause-a that's my line

**Warblettes: (singing)**

He does it fine

**Pasqually: (singing)**

But aaall the things I need to make-a-da mixture

Are harder to find

**Warblettes: (singing)**

Cause he's inclined

**Pasqually: (singing)**

Mozzarella, macaroni, mush-a-room, and parmesean

**Warblettes: (singing)**

Toss in the pan

**Pasqually: (singing)**

Milanesa, mortadella, onions, and parmesean

**Warblettes: (singing)**

Oh that's a lot

**Pasqually: (singing)**

Pizza, pizza, pizza in the air

Pizza, pizza, pizza everywhere

You take the pepperoni

Minestrone

Cannelloni

Dough

Then you add the garlic

'Cause'a that's'a good for you

**Pasqually & Warblettes: (singing)**

Pizza, pizza, pizza everywhere

Pizza, pizza, pizza in the air

You take the mostaccioli

Bagattelli

Vermicelli

Dooouuugh

Cook them in the oven

Then I'll serve it up

And dish it up

And cook it up

And eat it up

For yooouuu!
