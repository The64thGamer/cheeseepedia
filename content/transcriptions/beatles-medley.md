**Rolfe Dewolfe:**

Ok, get ready cause all you Showbiz Pizza lovers out there are going to be treated with The Rock Afire Explosion’s personal dedication to The Beatles!

**Earl Schmerle:**

Yeah, and here to start things off is our very own Beach Bear!

**[Song: You Can’t Do That]**

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

I got something to say that might 'cause you pain

If I catch you talking to that bear again

I'm gonna let you down

**All: (Singing)**

Let you down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And leave you flat

**All: (Singing)**

Gonna let you down and leave you flat

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Because I’ve told you before, oh 

You can’t do that

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Well it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him

Do I have to tell you one more time I think it’s a sin

I think I’ll let you down

**All: (Singing)**

Let you down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And leave you flat

**All: (Singing)**

Gonna let you down and leave you flat

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Because I’ve told you before, oh 

You can’t do that

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Everybody's 

**All (Singing)**

green

'Cause I'm the one, who won your love

But if it’s 

**All: (Singing)**

Seen

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine

I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind

I’m gonna let you down

**All: (Singing)**

Let you down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And leave you flat 

**All: (Singing)**

Gonna let you down and leave you flat

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Because I’ve told you before, oh 

You can’t do that

Because I’ve told you before, oh 

You can’t do that

**[Song: All My Loving]**

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

Tomorrow, I'll miss you 

Remember I'll always be true

And then while I'm away

I'll write home every day

And I'll send all my lovin' to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing

The lips I am missing

And hope that my dreams will come true

And then while I'm away

I'll write home every day

And I'll send all my lovin' to you

All my lovin'

**All: (Singing)**

Ooh

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

I will send to you 

All my lovin' 

**All: (Singing)**

Ooh

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

Darlin' I'll be true

**[Song: I saw her standing there]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Well she was just 17

You know what I mean 

And the way she looked 

Was way beyond compare

So, how could I dance with another?

Woo, when I saw her standing there 

Well, my heart went boom

When I crossed that room

And I held her hand in 

**Dook Larue & Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Mine

**Fatz Geronimo: (Singing)**

Dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip 

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

No, 

**All: (Singing)**

I'll never dance with another 

Woo, when I saw her standing there 

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Well since I 

**All: (Singing)**

Saw here standing there

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Well since I 

**All: (Singing)**

Saw her standing there 

Woo!
