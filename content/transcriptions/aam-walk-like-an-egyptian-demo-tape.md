**Steve White:**

And now, in case I'm not completely embarrassed, let's try to sing along with Walk Like an Egyptian, shall we? Okay, here goes nothing. This and- this is uh- the lyrics from 11/10/95. 

**Steve White: (Singing)**

In a distant land, amidst the sand, 

There stands a Sphinx and the pyramids. 

He's quite a guy. Oh-way-oh. 

He keeps an eye on the little kids. 

Find a dusty door that leads inside. 

Don't be afraid. Don't you run and hide. 

Push a secret stone Oh-way-oh. 

You hear a groan, then it opens wide. 

Hieroglyphs that look like this say 

“Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh.” 

Walk like an Egyptian. 

Stepping from the sun,  you need a torch.  

I think there's one out there on the porch. 

You can light the way, oh-way-oh

but do not play or you'll get a scorch. 

Through the dark and gloom, you'll find some rooms. 

They might be fun or they might be tombs. 

We can check them out, oh-way-oh. 

Be sure to shout if your terror blooms. 

Hulking tut who is waking up says “Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh.”

Walk like an Egyptian. 

Now Mr. Munch having lunch while sitting atop a sarcophagus. 

He hears a crunch. oh-way-oh. His punch sticks in his esophagus. 

Then Jasper Jowls starts to howl. 

The mommies are dancing on the prowl. 

They're all wound up, oh-way-oh 

We should round up and throw in the towel. 

Nowhere to run. We're undone. 

This pyramid party's not so fun. 

Then Chuck E. Cheese, oh-way-oh, says, 

"Please your attention everyone. 

I've met King Tut. 

Tell you what, he's no nut. 

He's really glad we're here 

and we can stay away, oh-way-oh

and play in these treasures. Have no fear.” 

Hulking Tut when he starts to strut says “Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh.” 

Walk like an Egyptian. 

Walk like an Egyptian

**Steve White:**. 

And we might want to add additional uh- there's 30 seconds currently on the uh- note- note also that I've added one additional fourline verse there more than on the original. Uh- and finally that we might want to extend the instrumental outro to have Chucky do a talk over to encourage kids in the theater to get up and walk like Egyptians.
