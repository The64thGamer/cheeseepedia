**Fatz Geronimo:**

Ok, ok, hello folks how ya'll doing out there? Fatz here and uh- We're continuing with our magic theme. I believe Dook's got a real nice Medley of songs for us, ain't that right there Dooky?

**Dook Larue:**

That's right Fatz! I'm gonna sing a song by uh- Abra- uh- uh- um- 

**Fatz Geronimo:**

What cha' gonna sing Dook? Cmon here, spit it out.

**Dook Larue:**

I'm gonna sing a medley- a medley of songs and one of them is called "Abracadabra" by Steve Miller, and the other one is uh- "You can do Magic" by America. 

**Fatz Geronimo:**

Oo I bet that's gonna come out fine-

**Mitzi Mozzarella:**

Hey! How come you get to sing both those songs, that is not fair! 

**Dook Larue:**

Well the Magic Show was my idea. 

**Mitzi Mozzarella:**

So what, who cares?

**Dook Larue:**

Well the boss said I could. Now, do I need any more reason than that?

**[Silence for a few seconds]**

**Beach Bear:**

Welcome to the cut-throat world of fast food entertainment. 

**[Everyone laughs]**

**[Song: Abracadabra]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

I heat up, I can't cool down

Got me spinning 'round and 'round

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes

Where it stops, nobody knows

Every time you call my name

I heat up like a burning flame

Burning flame, full of desire

Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher

**All except Dook: (Singing)**

Abra, abracadabra

I wanna reach out and grab ya

Abra, abracadabra

Abracadabra

**[Song: You can do Magic]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

I never believed in things that I couldn't see

I said if I can't feel it then how can it be

No, no magic could happen to me

**All: (Singing)**

And then I saw you

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

I couldn't believe it, 

**All: (Singing)**

you took my heart

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

I couldn't retrieve it, 

**All: (Singing)**

said to myself

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

What's it all about

**All: (Singing)**

Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic

You can have anything that you desire

Magic, and you know

You're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well

When you cast your spell you will get your way

When you hypnotize with your eyes

A heart of stone can turn to clay

**[Song: Abracadabra]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

You make me hot, you make me sigh

You make me laugh, you make me cry

Keep me burnin' for your love

With the touch of a velvet glove

**All except Dook: (Singing)**

Abra, abracadabra

I wanna reach out and grab ya

Abra, abracadabra

Abracadabra

**[Song: You can do Magic]**

**All: (Singing)**

You know darn well

When you cast your spell you will get your way

When you hypnotize with your eyes

A heart of stone can turn to clay

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

**[Song:Abracadabra]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

I feel the magic in your caress

I feel magic when I touch your dress

Silk and satin and leather and lace

A black dress with an angel's face

I see magic in your eyes

I hear the magic in your sighs

Just when I think I'm gonna get away

I hear those words that you always say

**All except Dook: (Singing)**

Abra, abracadabra

I wanna reach out and grab ya

Abra, abracadabra

Abracadabra

**[Song:You can do Magic]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane

And when the night it gets so cold, when I can't sleep

Again you come to me

I hold you tight, the rain disappears

Who would believe it

**All: (Singing)**

With a word you dry my tears

You can do magic

You can have anything that you desire

Magic, and you know

You're the one who can put out the fire

**[Song:Abracadabra]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Every time you call my name

I heat up like a burning flame

Burning flame, full of desire

Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

**[Song:You can do Magic]**

**All: (Singing)**

You know darn well

When you cast your spell you will get your way

When you hypnotize with your eyes

A heart of stone can turn to clay

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

And If I wanted to

I could never be free

I never believed it was true

But now it's so clear to me

**All: (Singing)**

You can do magic

You can have anything that you desire

Magic, and you know

You're the one who can put out the fire

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dip

You're the one who can put out the fire
