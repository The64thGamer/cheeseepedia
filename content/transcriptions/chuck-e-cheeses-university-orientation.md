**Employee:**

Hi, welcome to Chuck  E. Cheese’s!

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Voiceover)**

Customer satisfaction. Every company  tries to achieve it and few succeed. What do companies need to obtain customer satisfaction?  Well we think the reason we meet our service goals is that every person who visits us isn’t just a customer, but our guest! Someone we’re glad to see, and want to make happy. 80% of our business is generated between Friday afternoon and Sunday evening. And since families are at the core of our target audience, our job is to make the families that visit us part of our larger family.

**Todd Horchner:**

Hi. I’m Todd Horchner, your concept training manager. I’m really glad you’re here! You know, in 1977 we opened the first Chuck E. Cheese’s, then named Pizza Time Theatre, in San Jose California. A man by the name of Nolan Bushnell came up with the revolutionary idea to integrate technology in entertainment into our restaurant. And the rest is history.

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Voiceover)**

And speaking of history, ours is an exciting one. In 1980, Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz pizza were two different companies, often opening stores within miles of each other. After several years of direct competition, Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz merged as Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. Later in 1985, Dick Frank joined the company as president, placing the focus back on food quality, execution, and family satisfaction. In 1987, Terry Spaight joined the company as vice president and director of operations. And by 1988, Showbiz had spun off from the parent company and is now publicly traded. By the early 1990’s  we will break the 300 unit barrier with no end in sight! These units are company *and* franchise, and we predict an additional growth rate in the excess of 20 stores per year! First and foremost we are an operating company. And as a company we provide value to all guests by excelling in the areas of: product quality, fast friendly service, and clean well maintained facilities. In the food and entertainment industry, we’re number one! And nobody comes close. “Come for the pizza, and stay for the fun!” That’s our theme, and it’s backed up by a quality menu, a fantastic animated show, group party activities, and new games and rides that thrill every age! Chuck E. Cheese is where a kid can be a kid. Pizza is part of our name for a reason, our pizza is delicious! Six million, four  hundred thousand pounds of cheese are served each year. That makes for a lot  of happy pizza eaters! And what goes better with pizza than a fresh salad? Our salad bar features quality, fresh ingredients, and we take pride in offering only the best. We also serve five hundred thousand gallons of soft drinks a year as well! And children are special friends at Chuck E. Cheese’s. We search the world over for the latest developments in rides and games that will challenge and delight kids of all ages. It’s important for kids to win, and our skill games provide our young friends with fun as well as a challenging opportunity to test their skill talents. And birthdays are what  we do  best! Each Chuck E. Cheese’s hosts up to eighty birthday parties a week. Our unique robotic animation stage show provides a new level of entertainment to our young guests. These robotic characters appear to talk and sing with music synchronized to musical segments while their cartoon counterparts dance and sing on the video screen. Of course Chuck E. Cheese is the star of our show, Jasper T. Jowls , Ms. Helen henny, Pasqually, and the leader of the band, Mr. Munch! Our  live Chuck E. show offers our young guests an opportunity to see their talented friend sing and dance right in front of their eyes! You see, our service mission is “Every guest leaves happy!” has become more than just a slogan. It  represents the sincere desire of every member of our team to make each guest’s experience a happy one! We’re not  just in the food and entertainment business, we’re in the happiness business! Fun is our specialty, smiles and laughter are our main goals, and this is where you come in! Our  greatest  asset is our people, and our practice is to make work fun! Let’s make magic! Without it, we’re just another pizza place! You have been chosen to become part of  our special team because we recognize, in you, the abilities and dedication necessary to help us achieve our goal  and share the rewards! Each of our team members are trained in coat to be more than an employee, but to be part of our entertainment package. Did you know that Chuck E. Cheese’s employs more than seven thousand star  cast members nationwide? And as a new cast member, there are many things you should know! One of the most important items is the correct Chuck E.
