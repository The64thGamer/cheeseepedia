**Mr. Munch:** 

Man, with all those animals, I’d be worried about what to feed em

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Munch, what we feed our animals isn’t the only thing we should be worried about

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

Here’s a song from a different point of view 

about me and some friends of mine living in the wild and in the zoo. 

With each new season we try to adapt to every change 

but some of us are finding it so hard to rearrange. 

So all we ask is that you maybe could help us out. 

Cause basically you know that that’s what friends are all about. 

Tender love and care from your kind and gentle heart 

will buy us some time and that’s a great place to start. 

This is a favor we ask of you. 

Save us from extinction, 

help us see another day. 

Save us from extinction. 

I don’t mean to get too heavy and I’m not trying to bring you down 

but you know there are some animals that are nowhere to be found. 

All we are saying is this doesn’t have to be 

the end of the road for my buddies and me.

Now listen, in the wild and in the zoo, a game reserve, or park 

please take care of us just like Noah and his ark. 

The animal kingdom needs some loving too 

to keep the ecosystem happening so we can stay with you

**Jasper T. Jowls & Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Here is a favor

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

We ask of you. Save us from extinction

**Jasper T. Jowls & Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Help us see another day

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

Save us from extinction

**Jasper T. Jowls & Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

A home on the range 

and one with the land. 

We can all live here in peace. 

Save us

**Pasqually:(Singing)** 

Alright Jasper, wail on that thing, yes

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

Yeah yeah. 

Save us from extinction. 

Help us see another day. 

Save us from extinction

**Jasper T. Jowls & Helen Henny(Singing):** 

Help us see another day

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

Another one

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Alright. Don’t you disappear, we’ll see you in a little bit. So long
