**Narrator:**

Spanning the globe

**Mr. Munch:**

Oh my, have you been a naughty, naughty globe! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hold it Munch! He said spanning the globe, not spanking on the globe! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Hoho! 

**Narrator:**

It’s time for the Chuck E. Cheese News! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well hello news watchers, have I got a story for you! Well have I? Now what did I do with it, oh! Here it is, ladies and gentlemen this just in! 

**[Jasper walks into a scene behind Chuck]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ok that was just in and this is just out! 

**[Jasper walks out of frame, then back in, then out repeatedly]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

In, out, in, out, boy am I glad we finally got that cleared up. Now let’s see, what’s in the news? History was made today when our own Pasqually became the first pizza cook to set foot on the moon! And now let’s talk to him live, come in Pasqually! Eh- come in. 

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, boy that’s messy! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Come in Pasqually! 

**Pasqually:**

Chuck E, Oh and the tv people! Ciao everybody, hi mama! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Uh Pasqually, just why did you want to be the first pizza cook on the moon? 

**Pasqually:**

Well Chuck E, I’d heard the moon was made of green cheese but I just couldn’t believe it. Now that I’m here, I see that it’s not green cheese, it’s mozzarella cheese! It’s just like I thought! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Fascinating! Any other discoveries? 

**Pasqually:**

Why sure! The surface of the moon has an unusual crust. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What’s unusual about it? 

**Pasqually:**

It’s chewy yet crisp, just a touch of garlic to it! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Now hold on! 

**Pasqually:**

Oh, I’ve also discovered that the moons mountains are mushrooms! And the craters are really pepper! And- 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Pasqually are you trying to tell us that the moon is really a giant pizza? That idea sounds *half baked* to me! 

**Pasqually:**

Well it is half baked! I’d recommend putting the whole moon into a 350 degree oven for about another oh, 20 minutes or so and then perfecto! Mwah! And now back to you Chuck E! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thank you Pasqually!

**Pasqually:**

You’re welcome! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well folks, that report from outer space has run us out of time! So, until next time, this is Chuck E. Cheese saying: if something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to me!
