**[Song: On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe]**

Do you hear that whistle down the line
I figure that it's engine number 49
She's the only one that will sound that way

On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

From the great Atlantic Ocean
To the wide Pacific Shore

To the ones we see once more

And quite well known by all

The magic of the railroad, win the hearts of one and all
As we reach our destination on the Wabash Cannonball
