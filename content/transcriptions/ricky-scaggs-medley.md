**[Song: Heartbroke]**

**Uncle Klunk: (singing)**

Well, who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes?

Or the bitter direction of impending goodbyes?

I'm fallin', I'm folded, I'm welded in place,

At the sight of you standin' with streaks down your face.

You got your-

Go runnin' from the reason. Get your-

Heart broke

**Uncle Klunk: (singing)**

Well, cryin' when you're rich is a poor if you're lonely,

Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield.

But all is not lost, it is only mistaken.

A small consolation but I know just how you feel.

You got your-

**[Song: You've Got a Lover]**


**Beach Bear: (singing)**

The clubs are all closed and there's no where to go

When the sun wont show for hours

The streets have all emptied and lovers lay sleeping

And dreaming of each other.

**All: (singing)**

You've got a lover but it's not me.

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

He can't love you like I can

**All: (singing)**

There may be others yes I understand

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Will they love me-

Like you can.

There's acres and acres of heartbroken lovers

I know we're not the first ones

But sometimes it seems that it's just like a dream

That you try hard to remember.

**All: (singing)**

You've got a lover but it's not me.

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

He can't love you like I can

**All: (singing)**

There may be others yes I understand

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

But will they love me-

Like you can.

**[Song: Highway 40 Blues]**


**Fatz: (singing)**

These Highway 40 blues

I've walked holes in both my shoes

Counted the days since I've been gone

Well I'd like to see the lights of home

I've wasted time and money too

Squandered years in search of truth

In the end I had to lose

Lord about to pay my dues

Got them Highway 40 blues

Highway called when I was young

Told me lies of things to come

Fame and fortune lies ahead

That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams my mind is numb

Money's gone stick out my thumb

Eyes are filled with bitter tears

Lord I ain't been home in years

Got them Highway 40 blues

You know I've traveled all around

Rolling stone from town to town

Met pretty girls I have to say

None of them could make me stay

Well I've played the music halls and bars

Had fancy clothes and big fine cars

Things a country boy can't use

Dixieland, I sure miss you

Got them Highway 40 blues
