**Chuck:**

 I read in a book about the way the future would look and the future looks fun to me.

**Pasqually:**

and fun is fun!

**Chuck:**

There'll be more time for pleasure and since leisure is a Chuck E. treasure. The future looks fun to me.
I've got no crystal ball, just a really strong hunch that I'll be having a great time if I stick

with this bunch

**Munch:**

Always welcome

**Chuck:**

I greet each tomorrow with a jocularity 'cause the future looks fun to me

**Pasqually:**

Popularity and such vocabularity. Maybe travel in space will become quite
commonplace and that looks like fun to me. Yes it does

**Jasper:**

 Lots of movies coming 'round and since I'm a movie hound, the future looks fun to me

**Munch:**

 Well there's guys as smart as Einstein who do nothing all day

**Helen:**

 But sit around and dream of better games for us to play

**All:**

 And since having a good time is a priority, the future looks fun to me

**Kids:**

 Hey, we're all kids now, what's the future gonna look like anyhow?

**Chuck:**

 Oh the future will be fun for you, don't you think?

**Helen:**

 Yes I do

**Munch:**

 Yes I do

**Pasqually:**:

 Yes I do

**Jasper:**

 Thank you!

**Kids:**

 Even if we grow up, Mr. Cheese may we show up?

**Chuck:**

 Now that sounds like fun to me

**Helen:**

 Oh, me too

**All:**

 The band and I couldn't care if you're one hundred and one. We like kids of any age who like
having fun. We're proud to be purveyors of gladness and glee, so the future looks fun to me

**Helen:**

 Wait!

**Chuck:**

 What is it, Helen?

Helen

Isn’t the future gonna be high tech?

**Jasper:**

 Yeah, it’ll be real e-lectronic

**Munch:**

 I think it’ll be techno...techno…

**Helen:**

 Tec- no-rific!

**All:**

 That’s it! Tec- no-rific!

**Pasqually:**:


 Here's a little fact that amazes me, I can wash the dishes while I'm watching TV. They
microwave my food without heating the oven, I've got a food process that I'm really loving. My
'fridgerator is fridgerific. Kitchen appliances are Tec- no-rific

**All:**

 Tec- no-rific

**Pasqually:**

Modern life is divine

**All:**

Tec- no-rific

**Pasqually:**:

 And the future's looking fine

**All:**

 Tec- no-rific

**Pasqually:**:

 To be more specific the world we're living in is Tec- no-rific

**Munch:**

 To stay in shape I used to jog around the block, that's not the way of the modern day jog.
They got machines that put the hurt in every muscle. You stay in shape with just a little bit of
hustle. These new machines make your tuzzle look terrific. Better get me some Tec- no-rific

**All:**

 Tec- no-rific

**Munch:**

Modern life is divine

**All:** 

Tec- no-rific

**Munch:**

 And the future's looking fine

**All:**

 Tec- no-rific

**Munch:**

 To be more specific the world we're living in is Tec- no-rific

**Chuck:**

 My home computer boasts 64k. That's more than Voyager 1 by the way. My modem
hookup gives me mucho information. I'm out on top of the computer situation. These computers
make me feel very scientific upon a modern life that's Tec- no-rific

**All:** 

Tec- no-rific

**Chuck:**

 Modern life is divine

**All:**

Tec- no-rific

**Chuck:**

 And the future's looking fine

**All:**

 Tec- no-rific

**Chuck:**

 To be more specific the world we're living in is Tec- no-rific. We’ve had a Tec- no-rific
time. Alright, who’s the wise guy? Oh well, while we go figure this one out we’re gonna take a
break. But we’ll be back in a bit
