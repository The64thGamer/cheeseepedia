**[Song: Oh I Think My Pride Is Showing Again]**

**Mr. Munch:**

I’m getting that feeling again

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

You know, Munch, so am I

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Mr. Munch:**

Yes sir

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Pasqually:**

Oh, yes indeed

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I catch myself puffing up my chest

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Being American is simply the best

**All: (Singing)**

And we're not bragging cause we all know that it's true

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

And I’m bustin’ my buttons

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

When you're from the USA, you feel a special way about the place where you live

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Kids: (Singing)**

Cause I love our country

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Guess the kids are feeling it too

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

It's not nice to boast or brag

Munch & **Pasqually: (Singing)**

But every time I see our flag

**All: (Singing)**

I think my pride is showing again

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

I'll tell you what I know. 

Our constitution is a guarantee 

that we can be what we wanna be

**All: (Singing)**

And everybody has a chance to speak their mind

**Kids:**

Yeah

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

The millions of different faces 

this country of ours embraces 

makes it the best of the best. 

Oh yeah

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Kids: (Singing)**

Cause I love our country

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

And again

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

It's not nice to boast or brag

**Mr. Munch & Pasqually: (Singing)**

But every time I see our flag

**All: (Singing)**

I think my pride is showing again

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Alright everybody, clap along and sing with us. Let’s go

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah, you’re getting the idea

**Kids: (Singing)**

Cause I love our country

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Let’s see it now

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Kids: (Singing)**

Cause I love our country

**All: (Singing)**

Oh I think my pride is showing again

**Mr. Munch:**

Boy, am I feeling it

**All: (Singing)**

So proud, proud

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Let’s give the good old US of A a big round of applause. Hey everybody, what’s your favorite American symbol?

**Helen Henny:**

Washington DC

**Mr. Munch:**

The Declaration of Independence

**Pasqually:**

The Statue of Liberty

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Well Chuck E., for me it’s Old Glory. I get butterflies every time I see it. 

**[Song: You’re a Grand Old Flag]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

You’re a grand old flag, 

you’re a high flying flag 

and forever in peace may you wave

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

You’re the emblem of the land I love, 

the home of the free and the brave

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Every heart beats true under red white and blue

**Mr. Munch & Jasper T. Jowls:**

Where there's never a boast or brag

**All: (Singing)**

But should old acquaintance be forgot, 

keep your eye on the grand old flag

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

There's a feeling comes a stealing 

and it sets my brain a reeling

 when I’m listening to the music of a military band

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Any tune like Yankee Doodle 

simply sets me off my noodle. 

It’s that patriotic something that 

no one can understand

**Jasper T. Jowls & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Red white and blue, I am for you

**All: (Singing)**

Honest you’re a grand old, 

Honest, you’re a grand old flag. 

You’re a grand old flag,

You’re a high flying flag 

and forever in peace may you wave. 

You’re the emblem of the land I love, 

the home of the free and the brave

**Mr. Munch:**

Take it, Chuck E.

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Every heart beats true 

under red white and blue 

where there’s never a boast or brag

**All: (Singing)**

But should old acquaintances be forgot, 

keep your eye on the grand old flag! 

Hoorah!

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

I want to thank you all for joining us in our salute to America and now it’s time to introduce our grand old band. Helen Henny, Jasper T. Jowls, Pasqually, Mr. Munch, and I’m your host, Chuck E. Cheese. Remember, it’s people like you that make this country great. So long for now!
