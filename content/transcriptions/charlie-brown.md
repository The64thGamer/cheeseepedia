**Major Magic:**

Reading, writing, and arithmetic makes us school kids all frown! Heh! But here’s to the guy that makes recess fun! You all know him, he’s the class clown! Hehe. 

**[Song:Charlie Brown]**

**All: (Singing)**

Fe-fe, fi-fi, foo-foo, fum

I smell smoke in the auditorium

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown 

He’s a clown, that Charlie Brown

He’s gonna get caught

Just you wait and see 

**Sgt. Pepperoni:**

Why’s everybody always picking on me?

**All: (Singing)**

That’s him on his knees 

I know that’s him 

Yellin’, "Seven come eleven" 

Down in the boys gym

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown

He’s a clown, that Charlie Brown 

He’s gonna get caught

Just you wait and see 

**Sgt. Pepperoni:**

Why’s everybody always picking on me?

**All: (Singing)**

Who’s always writing on the walls?

Who’s always goofing in the halls?

Who’s always throwing spit balls?

Guess who

**Sgt. Pepperoni:**

Who me? 

**All: (Singing)**

Yeah you!

Who walks in the classroom, cool and slow?

Who calls the English teacher Daddy-O?

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown

He’s a clown, that Charlie Brown 

He’s gonna get caught

Just you wait and see 

**Sgt. Pepperoni:**

Why’s everybody always picking on me?

**[Saxophone solo]**

**All: (Singing)**

Who walks in the classroom, cool and slow?

Who calls the English teacher Daddy-O?

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown

He’s a clown, that Charlie Brown 

He’s gonna get caught

Just you wait and see 

**Sgt. Pepperoni:**

Why’s everybody always picking on me?
