**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thank you for coming to our press conference today! Many of you know us as Chuck E. Cheese and Munch’s Make Believe Band.

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

California, here we come! 

Right back where we started from! 

**All:**

Munch! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Haha! Well, Munch beat me to the punch, but it’s true! We are going to be performing on a regular basis here in Northridge, California! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

That’s in los Angeles California! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Here at a great little venue that’s perfect for a band like us! 

**Mr. Munch:**

It’s called a residency! 

**Helen Henny:**

Oh we’ll still be jamming in other places too! But we’ll be jamming in Northridge regularly!

**Pasqually:**

Yeah! We jam more than your printer! Heheheheheh. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That’s the news! We thought we should let you know officially. Especially all you super fans out there that want to know where to find us! 

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

It would be grand!

If you came to see the band! 

In sunny LA! 

On a beautiful day! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thank you Pasqually. That was beautiful. 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Uh- we’ll now be taking questions if you have any. Uh yes, you there! 

**Audience member:**

What inspired this residency? And why Northridge? 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Someone once told me: “go west young mouse!” So that’s exactly what we’re doing! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

We wanted to be somewhere the fans could always find us! 

**Mr. Munch:**

And SoCal has always been one of our favorite places to perform! 

**Helen Henny:**

California rocks! 

**Audience member:**

What will you be doing in your free time out in LA? 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Maybe I’ll take up surfing. That would be totally rad dude. Hahaha! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

I want to see the Hollywood sign! 

**Mr. Munch:**

I want to visit the observatory and look for my home planet! 

**Audience member:**

What do you say to the rumors that you’re breaking up?

**Pasqually:**

What? The band is breaking up?

**Helen Henny:**

Don’t worry Pasqually, that’s not really happening! 

**Mr. Munch:**

We’ll always be together! 

**Audience member:**

How do you never get tired of playing so many shows? 

**Helen Henny:**

We’re pretty good at finding time to recharge! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

It takes us a couple minutes to cool off, but then we’re back at it!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And we love performing sooo much, it’s practically hardwired into us! 

**Audience member:**

How have you all stayed in such good health? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

I take yoga classes. Haha. I do a real mean downward dog! 

**Mr. Munch:**

I use birthday cake frosting as moisturizer! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thanks for your time everyone! We’ll take one last question. 

**Helen Henny:**

We’ve got to get to rehearsing! 

**Audience member:**

When are you going to start performing in California? 

**Pasqually:**

Why not right now?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Let’s do it! 

**Helen Henny:**

Yeah! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
