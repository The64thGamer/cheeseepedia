**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?

You've been out ridin' fences for so long now

Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you got your reasons

These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy

She'll beat you if she's able

You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me some fine things

Have been laid upon your table

But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger

Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home

And freedom, oh, freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'

Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?

The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine

It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day

You're losin' all your highs and lows

Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes

Away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?

Come down from your fences, open the gate

It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you

You better let somebody love you (Let somebody love you)

You better let somebody love you before it's too late
