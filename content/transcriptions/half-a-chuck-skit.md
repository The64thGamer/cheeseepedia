**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Direct from the Pizza Time Theatre half off sale presenting me, Chuck E. Cheese, in my most revealing role ever. You see, when the Foothill College Electronics Museum asked me to signify as an example of technology, I said I’d give my all, but they only wanted half! And I thought I was a cut up. Well, it gave me a split personality, you see. Cause I got one foot in the theatre and a leg up on the latest electricity, I mean, only the stuff that’s current heh heh. Go ahead and groan, it don’t bother me. You see, I’m a little hard of hearing on this side here. But seriously folks, I’m showing off here! Disposing myself, as it were, so that you’s can get an idea of what goes on backstage. Techno-electrically speaking that is, you know. Let me show you how I do it. Don’t worry folks, it don’t hurt a bit. And as you watch me, and naturally you do, you can see that every movement I make is a combination of simpler actions. Like my mouth! And my head! And the mic! All controlled by my electronic brain! See, I’m not just another pointy face. Behind the wisecracks is some pretty high technology working hard to have fun! And take it from me, Chuck E. Cheese. That ain’t half bad.
