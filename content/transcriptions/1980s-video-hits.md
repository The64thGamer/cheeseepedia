Well, my baby and me went out late Saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right
Well, pick you up at ten, gotta have you home at two
Mama don't know what I catched off of you
But that's all right 'cause we're looking as cool as can be

**All: (Singing)**

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Make'em scream and shout
Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock till we pop
We're gonna rock till we drop
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out

**Mr. Munch:**

Hehe, Let's rock and roll baby, hehe

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey folks, hang on to your pizza. Me and the gang are gonna be right back in a flash and we'll rock this old town some more.
