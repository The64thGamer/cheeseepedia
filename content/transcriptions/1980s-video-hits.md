Well, my baby and me went out late Saturday night

Mama don't know what I catched off of you

But that's all right 'cause we're looking as cool as can be

**All: (Singing)**

We're gonna rock this town

Rock it inside out

We're gonna rock this town

Make'em scream and shout

Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock

We're gonna rock till we pop

We're gonna rock till we drop

We're gonna rock this town

Rock it inside out

**Mr. Munch:**

Hehe, Let's rock and roll baby, hehe
