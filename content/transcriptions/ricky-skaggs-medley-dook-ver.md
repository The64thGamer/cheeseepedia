And as ya’ll are probably aware if you come in here very often, we always try to put our show together with a theme. Uh, we do the magic shows where we had the magic theme and we’ve done trivia shows with trivia theme and old senior citizens and 50’s and stuff, and well today it’s uh- Beach Bear’s turn to decide what our theme is, so let’s call him out here and find out what great theme Beach Bears chosen for us today for The Rock Afire Explosion to sing songs about! Howdy everybody!

**[Song: Heartbroke]**

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Well, who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes

Or the bitter direction of impending goodbyes?

I'm fallin', I'm folded, I'm wilted in place

At the sight of you standin' with streaks down your face

You got your-

**All: (Singing)**

Heartbroke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

You go runnin’ from the reason

Get your-

**All: (Singing)**

Heartbroke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Don’t give up on believing in me 

**All: (Singing)**

Heartbroke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Who kept me from  leaving with my- 

**All: (Singing)**

Heart broke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Well, cryin' when you're rich is a bore, if you're lonely

Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield

But all is not lost, it is only mistaken

A small consolation but I know just how you feel

You got your- 

**All: (Singing)**

Heartbroke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Go runnin’ from the reason

Get your-

**All: (Singing)**

Heartbroke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

Don’t give up on believing in me 

**All: (Singing)**

**All: (Singing)**

Heart broke

**Dook Larue: (Singing)**

**All: (Singing)**

Heart broke

**[Song: You’ve Got a Lover]**

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

The clubs are all closed and there's no where to go

When the sun won't show for hours

The streets have all emptied and lovers lay sleeping

And dreaming of each other

**All: (Singing)**

You've got a lover but it's not me

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

He can't love you like I can

**All: (Singing)**

There may be others yes I understand

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

But will they love me 

like you can

There's acres and acres of heartbroken lovers

I know we're not the first ones

But sometimes it seems that it's just like a dream

That you try hard to remember 

**All: (Singing)**

You've got a lover but it's not me

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

He can't love you like I can

**All: (Singing)**

There may be others yes I understand

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

But will they love me 

like you can

**[Song: Highway 40 Blues]**

**Fatz Geronimo:**

These Highway Forty blues

I've walked holes in both my shoes

Count the days since I've been gone

And I'd like to see the lights of home

Well I’ve wasted time and money too;

Squandered years in search of truth

But in the end I had to lose

Lord about paid my dues

Got them Highway Forty blues

Highway called when I was young

Told me lies of things to come

Fame and fortune lies ahead!

That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams, my mind is numb

My money's gone, stick out my thumb

Eyes are filled with bitter tears

Lord, I ain't been home in years

Got them Highway Forty blues

You know, I've rambled all around

A rolling stone, from town to town

Met pretty girls I have to say

But none of them could make me stay

Well, I've played the music halls and bars

Had fancy clothes and big fine cars:

Things a country boy can't use

Dixieland I sure miss you

Got them Highway Forty blues...
