**Chuck:**


Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! Presenting a show like no other show! Some

songs...Jasper, pal. What's the problem, old buddy?



**Jasper:**


Well, Chuck E., sometimes I just feel like I don't have any friends. Well I mean, I know

that you guys are all my friends, but sometimes it's hard to make new friends.



**[Song: A World of Ways to say Hi]**




**Chuck: (Singing)**


Music, mistro Munch.

There's times you'd like to meet someone, but you're feeling a little shy.

The words don't seem to come out right and you think you're gonna cry.

Instead of feeling that you're gonna do something that's wrong, we'll show you how to meet most any person with this song.

To greet someone in English I'm sure you all must know.

To simply smile and shake their hand and give them a big "Hello!"



**Pasqually: (Singing)**
