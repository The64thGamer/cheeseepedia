**Pasqually:**

Ladies and gentlemen, we got a surprise for you. Keep your eyes on the door because the main man is about to come a rocking through it. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the one and only Chuck E. Cheese!

**All: (Singing)**

Here comes the guy

A special guy

The kind of guy that makes you feel alright

Oh yeah yeah yeah

He’s gonna shake and rattle and rock and roll at the bandstand

It’s Chuck E’s Bandstand!

It’s Chuck E’s Bandstand!

It’s Chuck E’s Bandstand!

It’s Chuck E’s Bandstand!

Cause rock and roll is here to stay

Chuck E. Cheese is gonna keep it that way

Rock and roll will never die

And we love Chuck E. Cheese

You’re at the bandstand

We’re gonna rock and roll
