**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

Everyone needs to come up with a way that works best for them you see

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

So I've devised a plan to burn off these extra calories

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

I'm country dancing myself in shape and it works for me just fine

**All:(Singing)** 

I'm country dancing myself in shape

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

And reducing my waistline. 

Well you can do aerobics and you can lift your weights

**All:(Singing)**

I'm country dancing myself in shape and it's really got me feeling great

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

Day and night I'm eating right, feeling better all the time. 

My heart's beating good like I know that it should, 

My boots and jeans fit just fine.
