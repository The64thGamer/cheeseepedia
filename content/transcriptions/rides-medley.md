**[Song: Palisades Park]**


**All: (Singing)**

Run run runnin'

Now the ride the runnin'

And a run run runnin'

Now the ride the runnin'

And a-

**Fatz:**

Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to ShowBiz Pizza's tribute to the circus. I am your honorable massacre of ceremonies Reginald J. Fattican, but uh you can call me Fatz. On our way to the big top why don't we stop off on the midway and ride some rides.

**Dook: (Singing)**

Last night I took a walk after dark

A swingin' place called Palisades Park

To have some fun and see what I could see

That's where the girls are

I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute

That girl I sat beside was awful cute

And when we stopped I gave that girl a hug

My heart was flyin'

Up like a rocket ship

Down like a roller coaster

Back like a loop-the-loop

And around like a merry-go-round

We ate and ate at the hot dog stand

We danced around to a rockin' band

And when we quit I gave that girl a hug

In the tunnel of lo-hove

You'll never know how great a kiss can feel

Until you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel

Well we fell in love

Ah-

Down at Palisades Park

**All: (Singing)**

Run run runnin'

Now the ride the runnin'

**Dook: (Singing)**

Down at Palisades Park

**All: (Singing)**

Run run runnin'

Now the ride the runnin'

**Dook: (Singing)**

Down at Palisades-

**All:**

Woo!

**[Song: On a Carousel]**


**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

Riding along on a carousel

Trying to catch up to you

Riding along on a carousel

Will I catch up to you?

Horses chasin', 'cause they're racin'

**All: (Singing)**

So near and so far

On a carousel

On a carousel

**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

Nearer, nearer by changing horses

Still so far away

People fighting for their places

Just get in the way

Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you

**All: (Singing)**

Still we're going 'round

On a carousel

On a carousel

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round

And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round with you

**Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

Up, down

**All: (Singing)**

Up, down, up, down too

**[Song: Spinning Wheel]**

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

What goes up must come down

Spinnin' wheel got to go 'round

Talkin' 'bout your troubles, it's a cryin' sin

Ride a painted pony, let the spinnin' wheel spin

Did ya find the directing sign

On the straight and narrow highway?

Would you mind a reflecting sign?

Just let it shine within your mind

And show you the colors that are real

**Billy Bob & Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)**

Dizzy

**Billy Bob: (Singing)**

First time that I saw you girl

I knew that I just had to make you mine

But its so hard to talk to you

With fellas hangin' 'round with you all the time

I want you for my sweet pet

But you keep playing hard to get

I'm going around in circles all the time

**[Song: The Night the Carousel Burned Down]**


**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Weren't you there when the carousel burnt down?

The fire and confusion, the smoke and the sound

I swear you there when the carousel burnt down

We were all around

The rings charred and tarnished all over the ground

And our heads hung down

And we all left town

The next day

**Beach Bear & Mitzi: (Singing)**

The children all cried when the carousel burnt down

The old ladies sighed when the carousel burnt down

The rest of us lied as the carousel burnt down

And the flames did fly

The pipes steamed and shrieked out a blazing goodbye

As the boiler died

And they melted down

The midway

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And we all left town

**Beach Bear & Mitzi: (Singing)**

The next day

And we all left town the next day

And we all left town

The next day

**[Instrumental outro]**
