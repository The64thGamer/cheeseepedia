**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Step right up, step right up, doctor Chuck E. Cheese here. Tonight I got a real special for ya. Its our organic pizza, filled with vitamins L, O, V, and E. Fellas, its garunteed to get ya up, and keep ya up.

**Pasqually:**

Ey boss! I know a girl who didn't-a have-a my organic pizza, she fell apart at the seams!

**[Chuck Laughs]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Was she a loose woman?

**[Chuck & Pasqually Laugh]**


**Pasqually:**

Ey everybody! Step up to the bar, and have a drink, or two, or three! And you can get as high as we are- up on our wall!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Then sit back and relax in this secluded rendezvous

**[Song: Cocktails for Two]**


**Crusty: (singing)**

In some secluded rendezvous

**[Someone Shouts Whoopee]**


**[Whistle Blown]**


**[Gunshot]**


That overlooks the avenue

**[Horns Blow]**


With someone sharing a delightful character

**[Someone Shouts 'Yickety Yickety']**


Of this and that with cocktails for two

**[Glasses Clink Twice]**


As we enjoy a cigarette

**[Wheeze, Cough]**


To some exquisite chansonette

**[Brief Fiddle Plays]**


Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath

The serviette with cocktails for two

**[Glasses Clink Twice]**


My head may go reeling

**[Slide Whistle]**


But my heart will be obedient

**[Heartbeat Twice]**


With intoxicating kisses for

The principal ingredient

**[Pop, Carbonated Fizz, Laughter]**


Most any afternoon at five

**[Four Tings]**


We'll be so glad we're both alive

**[Breath, Sigh]**


Then maybe fortune will complete the plan

That all began with cocktails for two

**[Glasses Clink, Glasses Break]**


**[Extended Gulping, Spits, and Hiccups]**


**[Musical Outro]**


**[Audience Applause]**
