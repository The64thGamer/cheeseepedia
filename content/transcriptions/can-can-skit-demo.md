**Crusty: (singing)**

Ma chere, ma chere
Joli toujours contraire
Donnez-moi le donnez chef

Cheri, cheri, you look like Gene Autry
Your figure is like Trigger, ma cheri
Bon vie von vie, von bon mot

Bon vie Vaughn Monroe B.O
What ze Hildegard, cheri

**[Applause]**


Oo la la! Bonjour!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey Crusty, where did you learn to speak French?

**Crusty:**

My great grandfather was French, he worked in a cat house.

**[Audience Laughter]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh yeah?

**Crusty:**

That's where he met his wife Fifi, but he divorced her.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Why?

**Crusty:**

'Cause she was a dog!

**[Audience Laughter]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey, wait a minute- wait a minute. Cats can't marry dogs, it's unnatural.

**Crusty:**

No you don't understand she was a cat, but boy what a dog!

**[Audience Laughter]**


You see, Fifi used to dance in the can-can.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What's a can-can? Two toilets side by side?

**[Chuck & Audience Laugh]**


**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Duhh my cousin used to dance around in the can.

**[Jasper Laughs]**

**Crusty:**

Now I'll do the song that made Fifi the most famous pussy in Paris.
