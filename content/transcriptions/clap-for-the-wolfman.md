**All: (Singing)**

Clap for the Wolfman

He gon' rate your record high

**Wolfman:**

Alright this is the Wolf Pack comin' at you with the immaculate words of wisdom for you to contemplate your mind upon.

**All: (Singing)**

Clap for the Wolfman

You're gon' dig him 'till the day you die

**Wolfman:** 

I want you to listen close 'cause what I got to give you you are gonna want to know forever. Now getch'ya close and I'm gonna let you know, all right. Hah, ha, hello all you big boppers, little boppers, and all you crazy cats out there. I'm the Wolfman coming at you almost live and in-person direct from Orlando, Florida, the animation capital of the world! It is my distinct pleasure to give you a brief close encounter of the animal kind with the coolest collection of critters to ever grace your face, and a preview of their newest show! I give you racks and stacks of the best on wax with the fabulous Wolf Pack 5.
