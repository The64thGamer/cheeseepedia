Hey guess what? We’re having a birthday party today and I’m so excited! Sorry I can’t stay and chat but there’s so much to do, ohh. 

**Todd Horchner:**

Birthday’s are very special here at Chuck E. Cheese’s. Well I guess you could say we’re the king of birthdays.

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Voiceover)**

Remember: “Every guest leaves happy!” And our guests always come first. Let’s look at our birthday party expectations. You are the first cast member the guest sees when arriving for a party. Make sure you give them a big smile and greeting before taking them to their table. To each guest, his or her birthday is special. Let them know we think they’re special too! Birthday’s are a team effort at Chuck E. Cheese’s, be sure to assist your fellow cast members in all aspects of birthday celebration. Pre-bussing and spot checks are extremely important to keeping the birthday area clean. Proper reservation taking is essential to our birthday business since each Chuck E. Cheese’s hosts up to 8 parties per wave every other hour, you must take special care in placing the reservations in the birthday book. Our birthday parties include: pizza, soft drinks, and cake. Table is decorated with hats, balloons, napkins, and plates. Each of our guests receives $1.75 in tokens, and our special birthday guest receives $3.75 in tokens. All this plus lots of fun for only $5.49 per person. Take the time to make sure the birthday table is set up correctly. Ta da! Now, when you’re setting up for a party, go over your pre-party checklist. First, make sure a completed reservation tent is on the table. Make sure all tables are completely set up including hats, balloons, plates, etc. Be sure to greet the party with Chuck E. Cheese at the front door. Introduce yourselves and let them know the party room is all set, then lead them into the showroom. At the table, be sure to give the parent an idea of the sequence of events, letting them know that while they are waiting for pizza there will be lots of entertainment for the kids to enjoy. Let them know when their pizza will be delivered and when the cake parade will take place. Always make birthday’s a big deal! Interact with the kids, let them know Chuck E will be along soon with more fun. Take the food order, place the order with a cashier, then return with the tokens and serve the beverages. It’s pizza time! Be sure to serve the pizza with that Chuck E. Cheese’s enthusiasm! Now it’s time to prepare the cakes. First remove a 6 inch single cake and the appropriate amount of sheet cake from the freezer. Cut one slice from the single cake and put the candles on it. Cut the sheet cake into 24 pieces and remove the amount needed for the other children participating in the party. Always remember to bus the tables throughout the party, this will give your guests room to open their gifts and you room to place the cakes. And let the show begin! Start the birthday tape and light the candles. With Chuck E. Cheese at the lead, bring all available cast members and proceed with our famous parade of cakes.

After Chuck E’s show, thank your guests and help them carry their presents to the car. Once again, remember to bus your tables throughout the party. Let’s go over the exact party sequence. First, Greet and seat your party. Explain the system to the parent and take their order. Serve the pizza enthusiastically. Remove needed amount of cake from freezer and place on the plates. Pre-bus, Pre- bus, Pre-bus! Begin the birthday show and participate in the parade of cakes. Box the leftover cake and assist the guest in their departure. You’ll see that the success of the parties all relies on timing and your organization. Then all it takes is having fun and serving the guests in whatever they need. Just remember, this is the most important day of the year for that birthday child. Give it your best. You’ve now been shown the birthday party procedures and expectations, now ask your trainer any questions you may have. Also, practice and study your materials to further your knowledge on the position. Have fun and good luck! 

**Todd Horchner:**

You’re in charge of making each birthday party a special one. We want each of our kid’s birthday party here at Chuck E. Cheese’s to be one they’ll never forget. Helen, great job! You ready for the next party? 

**Helen Henny: (Walkaround)**
