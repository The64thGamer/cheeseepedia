**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)** 

I was sitting at my desk at school one day, and they did a pop quiz out in front of me. I got a little bit dizzy, and my palms got sweaty, though I took notes I wasn't sure if I was ready, so I took a deep breath and got calmed down, all the answers that I lost were suddenly found. My friends stopped being muddy, I was so glad that I studied.

**Everyone: (singing)** 

I don't have straight A’s, but I put in the work, and I make the grades to the best of my ability, knowing that I tried is enough for me. I keep shooting for the stars. If I never make it there, I might still land on Mars and be closer to the prize even if it takes a million tries.

**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)**

So I brought my paper home showed mom and dad, they really really proud of the grade I had, even though it wasn’t perfect they could tell that I’ve been working, yeah a job well done has its own reward, sometimes you don’t know what moving toward till you get there in that moment and then you're so glad that you earned it.

**Everyone: (singing)** 

No I don’t have straight A’s but i put in the work and i make the grade to the best of my ability knowing that i tried is enough for me, I’ll keep shooting for the stars if I never make it there I might still land on Mars and be closer to the prize even if it takes a million tries.

You have to put in every effort, don’t be afraid to give it time, you've got to try a million tries.

**Everyone: (singing)**
