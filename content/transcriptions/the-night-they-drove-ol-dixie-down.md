**Billy Bob:**

Ok. We’re gonna slow things down now just a little bit and Beach Bear’s gonna sing a song that’s very special to all of us with Dixie little- with a little- Dixie- if you got a little- are you-. Do it again? Ok.

**Billy Bob:** 

Ok everybody, we’re gonna slow things down now just a little bit and Beach Bear’s gonna sing a song that’s very special to all of us. And if it’s not real real special to you, you’re gonna have to listen to it anyway because it’s the next song coming up. So I hope it means something to you, even if it don’t mean a thing to you! Cause- because this is the third time I’ve tried this introduction and I’m not gonna do it again ok? So this song tells the story of a tired and disenchanted rebel who stood and sadly watched as- I am gonna have to do this one again? No? Ok, uh, a rebel soldier who stood and sadly watched as the last glimpse of a dying dream faded away. How’s that guys?

**[Song: The Night They Drove Ol’ Dixie Down]**

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Virgil Kane is the name

And I served on the Danville train

'Till Stoneman's cavalry came

And tore up the tracks again

In the winter of '65

We were hungry, just barely alive

By May the 10th, Richmond had fell

It's a time I remember, oh so well

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the bells were ringing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the people were singing

**All: (Singing)**

They said, "Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na”

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Back with my wife in Tennessee

When one day she said to me

"Virgil, quick, come see,

There goes Robert E. Lee!"

Now, I don't mind chopping wood

And I don't care if the money's no good

You take what you need

And you leave the rest

But they should never

Have taken the very best

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the bells were ringing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the people were singing

**All: (Singing)**

They went, "Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na”

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Like my father before me

I will work the land

And like my brother above me

I took a rebel stand

Well He was just 18, proud and brave

But a Yankee laid him in his grave

I swear by the mud below my feet

You can't raise a Kane back up

When he's in defeat

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the bells were ringing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the people were singing

**All: (Singing)**

“Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na”

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the bells were ringing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the people were singing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the bells were ringing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the people were singing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

And all the bells were ringing

**All: (Singing)**

The night they drove old Dixie down

**Beach Bear: (Singing)**

Yeeeeeeeaaaaaaah!

**All: (Singing)**

“Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na”
