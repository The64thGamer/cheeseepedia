**[Song: Waltz Across Texas]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Yeehaw ha ha ha ha. 

**Harmony Howlette & Jasper T. Jowls & Warblettes: (Singing)**

Waltz across Texas 

With you in my arms 

Waltz across Texas with you

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

The songs that made the cowboys dance, that’s what we’re singing about now. But first we’re gonna bring out the little lady whose idea of moonlighting is to howl at the moon

**[Harmony Howls]**

**Mr. Munch:**

Every cowboy’s favorite coyote 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

The one, the only, Harmony Howlette. 

**[Everyone cheers]**

**Harmony Howlette:**

Howdy boys! 

**All but Chuck:**

Hi Harmony! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh Harmony, I’d waltz across anything with you! 

**Harmony Howlette:** 

Well, how about Texas?

**Harmony Howlette: (Singing)**

When we dance together, my world's in disguise

It's a fairyland tale come true

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

And when you, look at me

With those stars in your eyes 

I could waltz across Texas with you

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey Harmony, you ever hear a wolf whistle?

**[A wolf whistle sounds]**

**Harmony Howlette:**

No but I’ve seen a fox trot!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ough. 

**[Jasper and Harmony laugh]**

**Harmony Howlette & Jasper T. Jowls & Warblettes & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Waltz across Texas 

With you in my arms 

Waltz across Texas with you

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Like a story book ending

I’m lost in you charms 

**Harmony Howlette & Jasper T. Jowls & Warblettes & Pasqually: (Singing)**

And I could waltz across Texas with you

And I could waltz across Texas with you

**Pasqually:**

Hey boss, I know a pizza chef from Texas. He's a- so rich he doesn’t even have his Cadillac air conditioned.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh no? 

**Pasqually:**

He just keeps half a dozen cold ones in the fridge! 

**[Jasper cackles]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That was a very perpetrating statement there Pasqually. 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Very funny! Very Funny! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Tell us Harmony, where do you get your ideas for these little shows here?

**Harmony Howlette:**

Oh I just dream 'em up! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Really? They must be some nightmares! 

**Harmony Howlette:**

Thanks for the insult Big C.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You’re welcome, would you like another one?

**Harmony Howlette:**

No, my doctor put my ears on a diet.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Your ears are on a diet?

**Harmony Howlette:**

Yeah, listening to your bad jokes could make me a real fat head! 

**[Jasper cackles]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s too late sweetheart.

**Harmony Howlette:**

Alright, come one boys, let’s get on with the next song and leave Big C to his insults. 

**[Song:Bob Wills Is Still the King]**

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

The Honky Tonks in Texas were my natural second home

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of San Antone

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I grew up on music that we called western swing

**Harmony Howlette & Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

It don't matter who's in Austin, Bob Wills is still the king

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yee he he Haw! 

**[Song:San Antonio Rose]**

**The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Deep within my heart lies a melody

A song of old San Antone

Where in dreams I live with a memory

Beneath the stars, all alone

**Harmony Howlette:**

And now this next song is dedicated to an old cowboy I know named Joe. 

**[Song:Ragtime Cowboy Joe]**

**Harmony Howlette: (Singing)**

Out in Arizona where the bad men are 

And the only friend to guide you is an evening star

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

The roughest, toughest guy by far is ragtime cowboy Joe. 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Now when he starts stepping on the dance hall floor,

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

No one but a lunatic would start a war. 

**Harmony Howlette: (Singing)**

Wise men know his 44. makes me dance for fair. 

**Harmony Howlette & The Warblettes: (Singing)**

He always sings raggy music to the cattle

As he swings back and forward in the saddle

On a horse that is syncopated, gaited

And there's such a funny meter to the roar of his repeater

**Mr. Munch & The Warblettes: (Singing)**

How they run, when they hear that fellas gun 

Because the western folk all know

**All: (Singing)**

Well he's a highfaluting, scooting, shooting son-of-a-gun from Arizona

Ragtime Cowboy Joe 

He’s that cowboy, talk about your cowboy 

Ragtime Cowboy Joe 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What kind of a cowboy?

**All: (Singing)**

he's a highfaluting, scooting, shooting son-of-a-gun from Arizona

Ragtime Cowboy Joe 

He’s that cowboy

Ragtime Cowboy Joe 

Ragtime Cowboy Joe

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

You know what Big C?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What’s that? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

I think Harmony’s really gonna go far! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah, and as far as I’m concerned the sooner she goes there the better. 

**Jasper T. Jowl:**

Oh no! 

**[Jasper starts to cry]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Jeez folks, between Jasper’s love sick bugling and Harmony’s howling-

**[Harmony Howls]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

This show’s really going to the dogs! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

But I love her!

**Chuck E. Jowls:**

See ya’s around.
