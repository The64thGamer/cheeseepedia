**Harmony Howlette:**

There is a land, a western land, mighty wonderful, wonderful to see. It’s a land, it’s a land I understand, y’know? And it’s there I long to be.

**[Song:Deep in the Heart of Texas]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

The stars at night

Are big and bright

**All: (Singing)**

Deep in the heart of Texas

**Harmony Howlette: (Singing)**

The prairie sky

Is wide and high

**All: (Singing)**

Deep in the heart of Texas

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

The sage in bloom

Is like perfume 

**All: (Singing)**

Deep in the heart of Texas

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Reminds me of 

The one I love

**All: (Singing)**

Deep in the heart of Texas!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah, deep in the heart of Texas, that’s where we’re going. And to start us off the most unlikely cowboys this side of mars: Munch! 

**[Song: Texas Plains]**

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

I wanna drink my java from an old tin can

While the moon goes ridin' high

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

I wanna hear the song of a whippoorwill

I wanna hear the coyote cry

**[Harmony cries and Jasper attempts to also cry]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Alright, cry not scream you dummy.  

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh. 

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

I wanna feel a saddle close between my legs

Ridin' there out on the range

A- just a- going for an old ride, eatin pizza pie

Back on those texas plains

**Harmony Howlette: (Singing)**

Each night in my dreams

it somehow seems 

that I am back

Where I belong

**Jasper T. Jowl: (Singing)**

Just a country hick

Back in the sticks

Back where I was born

Well city lights

And city ways

Are driving me insane! 

Ho ho ho! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Jasper you just left yourself wide open for a joke but I’m gonna let it pass.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Thank you! 

**Harmony Howlette:(Singing)**

I wanna be alone

I wanna be back home

Back on those Texas plains 

**All: (Singing)**

I wanna be alone

I wanna be back home

Back on those Texas plains 

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

I wanna drink my java from an old tin can

While the moon goes ridin' high

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I wanna hear the song of a whippoorwill

I wanna hear a coyote cry

**[Harmony and Jasper cry]**

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

I wanna feel a saddle close between my legs

**All: (Singing)**

Ridin' there out on the range

A- just a- going for an old ride, eatin pizza pie

Back on those Texas plains

Back on those Texas plains

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah alright! Moving right along!
