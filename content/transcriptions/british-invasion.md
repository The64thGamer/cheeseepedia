Chuck E! The British are coming!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Who’s this, uh who, what in the name of rock and roll are you talking about?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

It’s the British Invasion Big C!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That was a long time ago , and besides we’re all friends again.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

I know that! I was referring to the rock invasion. This is a rock music show y’know, did you forget about the British?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

No I didn’t forget haha!

**[Song: I'm Henry the VIII, I Am]**


**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I’m Henry the eighth I am, Henry the eighth I am I am.
I got married to the widow next door.
she’s been married 7 times before and everyone was a Henry, she wouldn’t like a Willy or a Sam.
I’m her eighth old man, I’m Henry, Henry the eighth I am.
I’m Henry the eighth I am, Henry the eighth I am I am.
I got married to the widow next door.
she’s been married 7 times before and everyone was a Henry, she wouldn’t have a Willy or a Sam.
I’m her eighth old man, I’m Henry, Henry the eighth I am.

**Pasqually:** 

I was gonna be a rock singer!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

I think you better stick to making pizzas.

**[Song: I Can't Get No Satisfaction]**


**Pasqually: (Singing)**

I can’t get no, satisfaction

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Hey Big C, I heard the weather in Britain is reeeeeal different. 
Now why do you suppose it rains so much over there?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Probably cause they need some reason to carry all those umbrellas around.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

haha! You think that’s it?

**[Song: Bus Stop]**


**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Bus stop
Wet day
He’s there
I say 
“Please share my umbrella” 
Bus comes 
Bus goes 
He stays 
Love grows
Under my umbrella

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

All that summer we enjoyed it 
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we implored it
By August she was mine

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Every morning I would see him waiting at the stop
Sometimes he’d shop, and he would show me what he’d bought

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Other people stared as if we were both quite insane

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Someday my name and his, are going to be the same
That’s the way whole thing started, silly but it’s true
Thinking of our sweet romance, beginning in that cue

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Came the sun the ice was melting, no more sheltering now

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Nice to think that that umbrella

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Led me to her vow

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Folks, here’s the sound of some real British rock and roll royalty, the Rolling Stones!!

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain

**All: (Singing)**

But it’s all right now

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

In fact it’s a gas!

**All: (Singing)**

But it’s all right
Jumpin Jack flash it’s a gas gas gas
Jumpin Jack flash it’s a 
Gas
Gas
Gas

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Whoa I gotta catch my breath! And we’re gonna catch you in a little bit, and this time we’ll do some good ol’ yankee rock and roll! 

**The Warblettes: (Singing)** 

Yankee Doodle came to town to rock and roll all night!
