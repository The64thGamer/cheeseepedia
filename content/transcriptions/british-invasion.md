**[Song: I'm Henry the VIII, I Am]**


**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I’m Henry the eighth I am, Henry the eighth I am I am.

I got married to the widow next door.

she’s been married 7 times before and everyone was a Henry, she wouldn’t like a Willy or a Sam.

I’m her eighth old man, I’m Henry, Henry the eighth I am.

I’m Henry the eighth I am, Henry the eighth I am I am.

I got married to the widow next door.

she’s been married 7 times before and everyone was a Henry, she wouldn’t have a Willy or a Sam.

I’m her eighth old man, I’m Henry, Henry the eighth I am.

I was gonna be a rock singer!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

I think you better stick to making pizzas.

**[Song: I Can't Get No Satisfaction]**

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

I can’t get no, satisfaction

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Hey Big C, I heard the weather in Britain is reeeeeal different.  Now why do you suppose it rains so much over there?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Probably cause they need some reason to carry all those umbrellas around.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

haha! You think that’s it?

**[Song: Bus Stop]**

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Bus stop

Wet day

He’s there

I say 

“Please share my umbrella” 

Bus comes 

Bus goes 

He stays 

Love grows

Under my umbrella

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

All that summer we enjoyed it 

Wind and rain and shine

That umbrella, we implored it

By August she was mine


**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Every morning I would see him waiting at the stop

Sometimes he’d shop, and he would show me what he’d bought

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Other people stared as if we were both quite insane

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Someday my name and his, are going to be the same

That’s the way whole thing started, silly but it’s true

Thinking of our sweet romance, beginning in that cue

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Came the sun the ice was melting, no more sheltering now

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Nice to think that that umbrella

**Helen Henny & Pasqually: (Singing)**

Led me to her vow

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Folks, here’s the sound of some real British rock and roll royalty, the Rolling Stones!!

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

I was born in a crossfire hurricane

And I howled at my ma in the driving rain

**All: (Singing)**

But it’s all right now

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)** 

In fact it’s a gas!

**All: (Singing)**

But it’s all right

Jumpin Jack flash it’s a gas gas gas

Jumpin Jack flash it’s a 

Gas

Gas

Gas

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Whoa I gotta catch my breath! And we’re gonna catch you in a little bit, and this time we’ll do some good ol’ yankee rock and roll! 

**The Warblettes: (Singing)** 

Yankee Doodle came to town to rock and roll all night!
