**[Song: Going Downhill]**

**Fatz: (singing)**

It all started at the corner table

Sippin' on a Jack and Coke

By the end of the evenin'

We were actin' like married folk

The weekend weakened me and took me of my will

You got me-

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Ahh~

**Fatz: (singing)**

A goin' downhill

Goin' downhill

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

**Fatz: (singing)**

Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you

I-I-I've spent all my money

I have lost my respect

Y-you got me walkin' in circles, honey

I- I'm a- I'm a nervous wreck

Lord, one step ahead of a welfare dollar bill

You got me-

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Ahh~

**Fatz: (singing)**

A goin' downhill

A goin' downhill

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

**Fatz: (singing)**

Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Ahh~

**Fatz: (singing)**

Well I was voted most likely

A'back in Seventy Nine (Nine)

I'da made it straight to the top honey (Ahh)

All I needed was time (Time)

But you put a somethin' on me

So unreal, you got me-

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Ahh~

**Fatz: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

Goin' downhill

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

**Fatz: (singing)**

Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I think about you

From daylight to dawn

I bet I won't weigh 15 pounds

A'when they drag my body home

Like a junkie hooked on dope

I'm hooked on your thrill

You got me-

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Ahh~

**Fatz: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

A goin' downhill

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

**Fatz: (singing)**

Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Ahh~

**Fatz: (singing)**

A goin' downhill

Goin' downhill

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

Goin' downhill

**Fatz: (singing)**

Yeah, still I can't get my fill of you

Oh my little sugah'

Yeah, I can't get my fill of you

Oh yeah
