**Fatz: (w/ reverb)**

Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to ShowBiz Pizza, where we're payin' tribute to the greatest show on Earth. I am your aristocratic announcer Reginald Fattican, the massacre of ceremonies, but you can call me Fatz.

**[Fatz Scoffs]**

I would like to direct your attention, here to the center ring, where Mitzi will sing us a hit song from folk town- about the sad side of the circus, the sad tears of a clown.

**[Song: Tears of a Clown]**

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Now if there's a smile up on my face

It's only there tryin' to fool the public

But when it comes down to foolin' you

Now, honey, that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression

Give you the wrong impression

Really I'm sa-ad

**All: (singing)**

Sad, sad, sad, sad

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Oh, sadder than sad

**All: (singing)**

I'm hurt so bad

**Mitzi: (singing)**

You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad

**All: (singing)**

I pretend, to be glad

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Like a clown, I pretend to be glad

**All: (singing)**

Sad, sad, sad, sad

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Now there's some sad things known to man

But that ain't too much sadder than

The tears of a clown

When there's no one around

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Now if I appear to be carefree

It's only to camouflage my sadness

In order to shield my pride, I've tried

To cover this hurt with a show of gladness

But don't let my show convince you

That I've been happy since you

Decided to go

**All: (singing)**

Why did you go?

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Oh, I need you so

**All: (singing)**

I need you so

**Mitzi: (singing)**

I'm hurt and I want you to know

**All: (singing)**

Want you to know

**Mitzi: (singing)**

But for others I put on a show

**All: (singing)**

It's just a show

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Oo-hoo yea

Now there's some sad things known to man

But that ain't too much sadder than

The tears of a clown

When there's no one around

Just like Pagliacci did

**All: (singing)**

The great pretender

**Mitzi: (singing)**

I try to keep my sadness hid

Smiling in the public eye

**All: (singing)**

A great pretender

**Mitzi: (singing)**

But in my lonely room, I cry

The tears of a clown

When there's no one around

Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face

Don't let my glad expression

**All: (singing)**

Tears of a clown

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Give you the wrong impression

Don't let this smile I wear

**All: (singing)**

Tears of a clown

**Mitzi: (singing)**

Make you think that I don't care

The tears of a clown
