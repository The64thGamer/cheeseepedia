**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, prepare yourselves for the most stupendous, spectacular, fantastic, and fantasmagorical entertainment event of a lifetime! Presenting, The Tune Machine! 

**Pasqually:**

Mamma Mia!

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch:**

Wow!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Now hold your horses there Chuck E. I know we’re going to do our best to entertain these folks, but don’t you think you’re pouring it on a little bit thick?

**Helen Henny:**

Bagaw. Yes Chuck E, you should be more modest.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey! The Tune Machine is nothing to be modest about! It’s the most incredible invention in the history of entertainment, and I should know, I invented it. 

**Pasqually:**

Say, that must be the big machine you’ve been tinkering with behind the stage up here!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That’s right! 

**Mr. Munch:**

But Chuck E, what is The Tune Machine?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s part spaceship.

**All:**

Oooo.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s part time machine.

**All:**

Oooo.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Part jukebox.

**All:**

Oooo Wooo.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And part of a broken video game I found in back, in fact I have to put tokens in it before every show!

**Helen Henny:**

Bakaw. But Chuck E, just what does it do?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well, no matter what song we sing, The Tune Machine can magically take us to the place we’re singing about! 

**[Everyone groans]**

**Pasqually:**

Oh yeah? Uh huh

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

You mean if we were singing a song about outer space The Tune Machine would take us there?

**[Everyone but Chuck E. laughs]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Exactly! Tune Machine!

**Tune Machine:**

Affirmative.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Do what Jasper said, take us to outer space!

**Tune Machine:**

Energize.

**[Sounds of a spaceship taking off]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Wait a minute, I thought you were kidding!

**Mr. Munch:**

Holy cow, what’s happening?

**Pasqually:**

Did I ever mention my fear of flying?

**Helen Henny:**

Oh my, hang on b- boys!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Here we gooooooooooo!

**All:**

Woah!

**[Song: Swinging On A Star]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Now this is really *far out*!

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Would you like to swing on a star?

Carry moonbeams home in a jar

And be better off than you are

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears

Kicks up at anything he hears

**The Warblettes: (SInging)**

His back is brawny but his brain is weak

He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

And by the way, if you hate to go to school

**All: (Singing)**

You may grow up to be a mule

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Or would you like to swing on a star?

Carry moonbeams home in a jar

And be better off than you are

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face

His shoes are a terrible disgrace, baw

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

He has no manners when he eats his food

He's fat and lazy and extremely rude

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

But if you don't care a feather or a fig

**All: (Singing)**

You may grow up to be a pig

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Or would you like to swing on a star?

Carry moonbeams home in a jar

And be better off than you are

You could be swingin’ in a star

**All: (Singing)**

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

**Pasqually:**

That’s right!

**All: (Singing)**

Every day you meet quite a few

**Mr. Munch:**

I’ve met a lot of em’

**All: (Singing)**

So, you see it's all up to you

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Don’t monkey around!

**All: (Singing)**

You can be better than you are

You could be swingin' on a star

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

So, what do you think of my Tune Machine now?

**Pasqually:**

It’s wonderful!

**Mr. Munch:**

Great!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Absolutely splendiferous! 

**Helen Henny:**

Yes, it’s marvelous! And outer space is so beautiful, bagaw.

**Pasqually:**

Uh, Chuck E, can I try The Tune Machine now?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Certainly! 

**[Pasqually clears his throat]**

**Pasqually:**

Tune Machine?

**Tune Machine:**

Affirmative 

**Pasqually:**

Oh, uh- our next song takes us deep underwater! Can we go there please?

**Tune Machine:**

Energize

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Underwater? Gee Pasqually, that’s a looong way down from up here. 

**Pasqually:**

Oh, I didn’t think of that. 

**Mr. Munch:**

Here goes nothing!

**Helen Henny:** 

Hold your breath!

**[Sounds of a spaceship taking off]**

**All:**

Woah! 

**[The sound of a splash of water and bubbles]**

**[Song: Octopus’s Garden]**

**Pasqually:**

We made it! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Wow! The bottom of the ocean!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Good thing I’m part water spaniel!

**[Munch and Pasqually laugh]**

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

I'd like to be

Under the sea

In an octopus's garden

In the shade

He'd let us in

Knows where we've been

In his octopus's garden

In the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see

An octopus's garden with me

**Pasqually & The Warblettes: (Singing)**

I'd like to be under the sea

In an octopus's garden

In the shade

**Helen Henny:**

Do you really think there's really an octopus around here?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Nah, the sharks scare em off.

**Pasqually:**

You think there are sharks?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Nah, the whales scare them off.

**Mr. Munch:**

You think there are whales here?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Nah- 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Hold it, hold it! If anything scares whales, I don’t want to know about it!

**[Everyone laughs]**

**Mr. Munch & Pasqually: (Singing)**

We would shout

**The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Woah oh

**Mr. Munch & Pasqually: (Singing)**

And swim about 

The coral that lies beneath the waves 

**The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Lies beneath the ocean waves

**All: (Singing)**

Oh, what joy for every girl and boy

Knowing they're happy, and they're safe 

**The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Happy, and they're safe

**Jasper T. Jowls & Pasqually: (Singing)**

We would be so happy, you and me

No one there to tell us what to do

**All: (Singing)**

I’d like to be

**The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Woah oh

**All: (Singing)**

Under the sea 

In an octopus's garden with you

In an octopus's garden with you

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

In an octopus's garden with you

**Pasqually:**

Chuck E, I admit I was skeptical at first, but I think your Tune Machine really is as great as you said it was!

**All:**

Yeah!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thank you! If I say so myself, it’s almost perfect.

**Helen Henny:**

Bagaw, Chuck E what do you mean *almost* perfect?

**Mr. Munch:**

Yeah?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well, I don’t have all the bugs out of it yet.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

What kinda bugs? Water bugs?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

No, no, no, no, no, it’s just that I haven’t quite figured out a way for it to get us home again.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

You gotta be kidding me!

**Helen Henny:**

What? Oh no!

**Pasqually:**

What? What do you mean?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You see, it can only take us somewhere that we can sing about. And there just aren’t any songs about our restaurant. 

**Pasqually:**

Then what are we gonna do?

**Helen Henny:**

Bagaw, looks like I’ll be the chicken of the sea.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Wait, wait. I’ve got an idea. We can just drive home!

**Mr. Munch:**

We can?

**Pasqually:**

But how?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Tune Machine!

**Tune Machine:**

Affirmative.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Tune Machine, put us in a fast car, on the highway that goes everywhere! Route 66!

**Tune Machine:**

Energize.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Good thinking Jasper, we’ll be home in no time!

**Pasqually:**

If we don’t get caught in traffic.

**All:**

Woah!

**[Song: (Get your kicks on) Route 66]**

**Helen Henny:**
