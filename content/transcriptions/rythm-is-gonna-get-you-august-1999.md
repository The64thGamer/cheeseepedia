**Narrator:**

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, sit back, fasten your seatbelts, and get ready for a musical spin around the planet!
It's Chuck E. Cheese's Fabulous World Adventure! And here to put a super spin on that terrific trip, it's the mouse with a tale to tell: Chuck E. Cheese!

**[Applause]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey hey hey! Thank you very much, and right now I'd like to introduce my companions in travel and so-

**Bird:**

SQUAWK! That's me!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Heh, well actually bird, I was referring to those who traveled with me around the world!

**Bird:**

Oh, well... Like, like who?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well, like Helen Henny! Whose golden voice has been heard around the world! Munch, who has his fingers on the pulse of the planet. Pasqually, the man with the world beat! And Jasper, the music hound who really digs the earth! Hey everyone!

**Pasqually:**

Hey- hello Chuck E.

**Jasper:**

Hey there Chuck E.

**Mr. Munch:**

How ya' doin'?

**[Bird whistles]**


**Bird:**

Boy, heh-heh, I wish I could've had all that fun going around the world with you!

**Jasper:**

Well, it's almost as much fun reliving the trip by looking at all the pictures we took!

**Pasqually:**

Y-Yes, see, then it's a good thing we took lots of pictures on our trip around the world.

**Mr. Munch:**

Yeah! Let's show the pictures, I can hardly wait to relive our adventure!

**Chuck E.:**

Well then let's not wait! Uh, Larry, could you start with the pictures of everyone loading up the ATW?

**Larry:**

Right away, Chuck E.!

**Bird:**

Um, I-I hey Chuck E? What does ATW mean?

**Chuck E.:**

Oh yeah, thanks for asking, Bird. ATW is short for All-terrain Winnebago.

**Bird:**

Oh!

**Larry:**

Ah- Hey, Chuck E., are these the pictures?

**Helen:**

Oh, look everybody! There we are in front of the ATW, our favorite way to travel.

**Pasqually:**

Heh, yes, and there we are getting all our suitcases on the ATW!

**Jasper:**

And there we are packing the suitcases!

**Mr. Munch:**

And there's Pasqually dropping the suitcases!

**Pasqually:**

And there's Munch tripping over the suitcase I dropped!

**Helen:**

There Jasper is packing more suitcases on top of Munch!

**Chuck E.:**

Those look great Larry! Just keep the slides coming and we'll tell everyone about our trip around the world! So, uh, who here wants to start?

**Helen:**

Oh, I do! Well, we hit the road and started down south. All the way to South America!

**Bird:**

Wow! It's a long drive to South America!

**Pasqually:**

And the whole time, Munch kept asking-

**Mr. Munch:**

When are we gonna get there? And-

**All:**

Are we there yet?

**Pasqually:**

So, we decided to do something fun to pass-a the time.

**Jasper:**

And everyone knows that one way to have a howling good time on a trip is to sing songs!

**Chuck E.:**

That's right! Of course in South America, they have Latin music! Which has such a wonderful rhythm, it makes you want to dance!

**Mr. Munch:**

Yea

**Jasper:**

Oh, really?

**Helen:**

Yea!
