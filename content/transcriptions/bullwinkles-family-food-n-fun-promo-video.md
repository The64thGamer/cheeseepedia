**Narrator:**
This is Bullwinkle’s Family Food N’ Fun Restaurant. Developed around the internationally famous Bullwinkle the Moose and Rocky the Flying Squirrel cartoon characters, the restaurant has a Canadian north woods exterior design and interior decor. The totem poles are an example of theming, using some of Bullwinkle’s more than 40 licensed cartoon characters. This pole for instance has hand carved reliefs of Mr. Peabody and Sherman, two popular characters from the Bullwinkle cartoon show. This 40 foot tall inflatable Bullwinkle balloon is used for about three weeks to promote the grand opening of each restaurant. Bullwinkle’s colossal size makes the balloon an attraction in itself. Bullwinkle’s customers are surrounded with the fantasy of the restaurant from the moment they approach the doors. Visual entertainment abounds in the restaurant's fun interior environment. Intriguing artifacts, quick witted graffiti, impressive woodwork and environmental sounds add to the experience. Snidley Whiplash is the animated villain in Dudley Do-Right’s Lock Up. 

**Snidley Whiplash:**

Where did I go wrong? Compose yourself, Whiplash, you’ll get to the seat of this problem! It’s that Do-Right! I must get him out of my slickbound hair once and for all!  

**Narrator:**

His comic comments are a distraction for all on their tour to the food order counter. Bullwinkle’s customers choose from our wide variety of delicious menu items including: Bullwinkle’s Fa-Moose Pizza, our own special deep dish, double crusted, stuffed pizza. Family style Klondike Fried Chicken. Sweet Polly’s self-serve salad side board which features: garden fresh salad, salsa macaroni salad, fresh fruit salad, and daily pasta with four Moose-ellaneous dressings including our own house special. Bullwinkle’s traditional thin crust pizzas are called Dudley Do-Right’s Done-Right Pizza’s. The house specials are appropriately named, Mother-Lode Pizza, Garden Cache Pizza, and our unique Pizza Of The Sea. Bullwinkle’s menu also features Underdog’s Heroic Sandwiches, beverages, and 8 delicious desserts with character like Rocky’s Road, Snidley’s Whiplash, and of course, Bullwinkle Mousse. Food orders are received on  remote kitchen printer to expedite customer meal preparations. When ready, order numbers appear on television monitors located throughout the restaurant notifying customers to come to the pick up window for their freshly prepared meal. Bullwinkle’s tempting desserts and beverages are prepared for customer pick up at the adjacent counter. The main dining room is Bullwinkle’s Showroom. It is themed with a variety of rustic looking but attractive lamps, dozens of eye-catching nicknacks and some not so likely graffiti. Employees wear an attractive deputy mountie uniform in theme with the restaurant decor and our co-star, Dudley Do-Right of the Royal Canadian Mountie’s. The tiered seating and theatre shape of Bullwinkle’s showroom provides a comfortable atmosphere for families while they dine and watch the Bullwinkle show. When the curtains rise on the animated, computer controlled Bullwinkle show the audience is in for the kind of humor they’ve come to expect from Bullwinkle, Rocky, and the forever blundering Dudley Do-Right. 

**Dudley Do-Right:**

Inspector Fenwick! I know I can do the number now! Everything is working like clockwork!

**Bullwinkle:**

Yeah, a koo koo clock!

**Rocky:**

I think Dudley should go practice on top of the Canadian Rockies!

**Bullwinkle:**

What’re you talking to yourself for?

**Rocky:**

What do you mean?

**Bullwinkle:**

You said Dudley should go practice on top of the Canadians, Rocky.

**Rocky:**

I said Canadian Rockies!

**Bullwinkle:**

Oh! You have family in Canada?

**Rocky:**

After this conversation we’ll gladly listen to Dudley Do-Right!

**Dudley Do-Right:**

This time, nothing will go wrong! 

**[Sounds of Dudley’s curtain going up slowly]**

**Dudley Do-Right:**

Oh, I am-

**[The fountains in front of the stage start going off in front of the stage]**

**Dudley Do-Right:**

Hey now! What’s going on? Oh, water! Oh fudge. Well, two can play at this game.

**[Dudley starts to poorly sing]**

**Dudley Do-Right: (Singing)**

By a waterfall, at Camp Resolution!

**Dudley Do-Right:**

Oh darn, it looks like I’m all “washed up”.

**Narrator:**

Bullwinkle’s brand of humor even extends to poetry recitals.

**Bullwinkle:**

Hello poetry lovers! Today’s poem is entitled “What is a Friend?”. 

There is nothing quite like a friend.

Someone to stick with you right to the very end.

A friend can be a moose, a boy, or a girl. 

A dumb old walrus, or a flying squirrel.

**Rocky:**

Gee, thanks Bullwinkle! 

**Chumley:**

Uh yeah, that goes for me too.

**Bullwinkle:**

Friends come in all colors, shapes, and sizes

They’re full of fun and full of surprises.

**[Dudley’s curtains open and he plays music on his gramophone]**

**Bullwinkle:**

Hey wait just a minute! Can’t you see I’m doing a poetry recital?

**Dudley Do-Right:**

Oh, sorry about that. 

**[Dudley’s music stops and his curtain closes]**

**Bullwinkle:**

Friends can be penguins who live in the cold.

**Tennessee Tuxedo:**

Right you are!

**Bullwinkle:**

Friends can be turtles who live to be old!

**[Tooter Turtle plays his drums]**

**Bullwinkle:**

Friends can be found in the swamp like a frog.

**[Hoppity Hooper plays his harmonica]**

**Bullwinkle:**

Or hanging around fire hydrants, just like a dog.

**[Underdog plays his saxophone]**

**Bullwinkle:**

A friend will be there in your time of need. 

A friend is not full of meanness or greed. 

**Boris Badenov:**

Brother, with friend like moose, who needs enemies?


**Natasha Fatale:**

But Boris darling, Moose is your enemy!

**Boris Badenov:**

Oh yeah! With enemy like moose, who needs friends! 

**[Scene changes to show the fountain show in front of the stage]**

**Narrator:**

The entertainment in Bullwinkle’s showroom continues with the Fantasy Fountain show! The fascinating indoor water show utilizes 278 computer controlled water jets to create 18 different movements synchronized with a wide range of time-tested popular music. 

**[Fountains move along with the original Star Wars theme]**
