**Kid:**

??? grown ups talk about how they used to have so much fun, yeah right! They didn't even have Chuck E. Cheese's back then. They called this the good old days? That's nothing compared to the fun we have now! And do you know what they used to eat? Yuck! At Chuck E. Cheese's we do it right! So the next time they talk about the good old days, just go along with them. 

**Kids: (Singing)**

Chuck E. Cheese's, where a kid can be a kid!
