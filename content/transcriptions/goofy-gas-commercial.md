**Billy Bob:**

So long Mrs. Jones!

**Mrs. Jones:**

See ya later Billy Bob!

**Billy Bob:**

Well looney bird, it sure has been a busy day! 

**Looney Bird:**

I know Billy Bob, this Goofy gas has been selling like hotcakes!

**Billy Bob:**

Hehe! You're right there looney bird. 

**Looney Bird:**

Yeah!

**Billy Bob:**

You know, you better go down and check and see how much we got before any more customers come in.

**Looney Bird:**

Boy you said it! Right away Billy Bob.

**[Growing Slurping sound]**


**Billy Bob:**

Y'know me and Looney bird feel that we owe it to America to come up with some form of alternative fuel! Y'know the price of gas the way it is and all, y'know it's really important for everybody to do their part and do what they can to sort of help America come by with another fuel source. And that's why we invented goofy gas! It's all natural and it's made from fresh corn squeezin's and- and we make it right here at Smitty's Super Service Station!

**[Slurping stops, then resumes after a swallowing sound]**


 **Billy Bob:**

And Every Tuesday here at Smitty's Super Service Station it's Goofy Gas day! And you know what that means don't cha? That means you get a tank full free with fill up! Right Looney Bird?

**[Slurping stops again followed by another swallow]**


**Looney Bird:**

Right Billy Bob!

**Billy Bob:**

So do your part to help your country's energy problems and come into Smitty's Super Service Station and try a tank full of Goofy gas! It's only 59 cent a gallon

**Looney Bird:**

Yeah! Or a dollar sixty nine a six pack!
