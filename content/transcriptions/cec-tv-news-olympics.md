**Narrator:**

Spanning the globe

**Mr. Munch:**

Woah, woah, woooaaah, easy! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hold it Munch! He said spanning the globe, not standing on the globe! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Oh, haha! Ah! 

**[Munch falls off the globe]**

**Narrator:**

It’s time for the Chuck E. Cheese News! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well hello everybody! These are the big stories we’ll be looking at tonight, tonight when I’m all snuggly in bed that is. I can’t wait to see how this 3 Bears thing turns out! Ah, um but now it’s time for the news, and the biggest news story at the moment is our very own Chuck E. Cheese Olympics! And here with all the details, or maybe it’s dog tails, is our own sports hound: Jasper T. Jowls! 

**[Scene shifts to Jasper in a arcade of a Chuck E. Cheese’s]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Thank you Chuck E! I’m here to report on the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh the feet still bothering you huh? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yeah I think these new store bought shoes are just too small! Ye ouch! Now, let’s talk about the Chuck E. Cheese Olympics! Only moments ago the United States won the gold medal in the skeeball competition! Thanks to this shot by team captain Barney Bernthal!  And now, let’s take another look at that winning shot using our exclusive skeeball cam! He gets his grip, there’s the wind up, he lets go and, It’s in! Woo, that skeeball can always makes me dizzy. While I recover, let’s see the final round of the ball crawl competition, Pasqually let’s go! Woah, woah! 

**[Scene shifts to Pasqually by the ball crawl]**

**Pasqually:**

Thank you Jasper! Yes we’re just about to judge the finalist in the ball crawl diving event! And here comes our first contestant now! Oh that was just great! Here are our scores. 8.0, I thought that was a great dive!

**Helen Henny:**

I gave 8.3, I really loved it! 

**Mr. Munch:**

I have nothing point nothing! 

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:**

What? 

**Mr. Munch:**

Well I was looking the other way, didn’t even see it. Sorry. 

**Helen Henny:**

And now here comes contestant number 2! 

**Pasqually:**

Ooo a tough dive, well done! 9.1! 

**Helen Henny:**

I’ll agree but his approach wasn’t quite perfect, 8.7. 

**Mr. Munch:**

And I have 1,527! 

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:**

What? 

**Mr. Munch:** 

Well weren’t we supposed to be counting the balls? 

**Pasqually:**

No! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Here comes our last contestant!

**[Jasper falls into the ball pit]**

**Pasqually:**

He’s not even supposed to be a contestant! 2.5. 

**Helen Henny:**

I gave him a 3.0! Sorry Jasper! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Well I’m giving him a perfect 10! 

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:** 

What? 

**Mr. Munch:**

Well I have to give him a 10! See he loaned me this $10 a week ago and I just hate to owe anybody money!

**Helen Henny & Pasqually:**

Munch! 

**Mr. Munch:**

And this whole judging thing is pretty confusing! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh that does it! No more skeeball cam for me! But I’m pleased to report that the results of the ball crawl judging are in and everyone is a winner! Here at the Chuck E. Cheese Olympics! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And that’s just the way we like it! Thanks Jasper! And thank you for tuning in! Until next time this is Chuck E. Cheese with the Chuck E. Cheese news saying: if something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to me!
