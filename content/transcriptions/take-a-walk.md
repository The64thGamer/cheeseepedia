**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)**

All these kinds of place's make it seem like it been age's, tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky  

I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly, but I never thought I'd be alone to try


**Chuck E. Cheese and Moon: (singing)**

Once I was outside Penn station selling red and white carnations, we were still alone my wife and I 

Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over now I want to bring my family state side 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)**

But off the boat they stayed awhile and scattered across the cost, once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most, I took a walk

Practice isn't perfect with the market cuts the loss, I remind myself that times could be much worse, my wife won't ask me question there's not so much to ask and she'll never flaunt around an empty purse 


**Chuck E. Cheese and Moon: (singing)**
Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights then decided she would stay there the rest of her life, I watched my little children play some board game in the kitchen and I send them home and they never feel my strife 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)**

then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone, he made some bad investments now the counts are overdrawn, I took a walk

honey it's your son I think I borrowed just too much, we had taxes, we had bill's, we had a lifestyle to front


and tonight, I swear I'll come home and will have fun like were young, and tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids, we can stay away from negative's and all their bad idea's, you see I am no criminal I'm down on both bad knees, I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need, I took a walk
