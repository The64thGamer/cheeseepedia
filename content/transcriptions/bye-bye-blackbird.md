Pack up all my cares and woes

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird- yours Jasper!

No one here can love
Or understand me

Make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

Make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye
Blackbird, bye, byeeeeeee!
