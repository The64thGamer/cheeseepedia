**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey folks, we need you to help us celebrate a birthday for somebody special

**Mr. Munch:**

Yeah, It’s my girlfriend’s birthday!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Maybe so, but I was referring to one of my friends out there

**All: (Singing)**

Happy Birthday to you

Happy Birthday to you

Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday

Happy Birthday to you

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Time to call my baby, call her on the telephone 

Yeah, time to call my baby, call her on the telephone

Lately when I call her, she never seems to be at home

Well today’s her birthday and I know she’s out celebrating

Yes, today’s her birthday and I know she’s out celebrating

And here I’m sitting all alone and I’m getting real tired of waiting

**All: (Singing)**

Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday

Happy Birthday to you

**Mr. Munch:**

Happy Birthday Honey, hehe

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Happy Birthday!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And a special Happy Birthday to you out there.

**Mr. Munch:**
And I really mean it.
