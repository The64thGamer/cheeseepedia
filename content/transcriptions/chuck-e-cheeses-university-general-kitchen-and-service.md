Remember, every guest leaves happy! And our guests always come first, let’s take a look at the service and kitchen general expectations. It is every cast member's job to make sure that each feels at home at Chuck E. Cheese’s. Assist your fellow team members at all times, and be sure to stay one step ahead of the guest’s needs. Before and during business hours it is extremely important to keep all areas clean. A clean environment is enjoyable for not only the guest but you, the cast member, as well. Proper maintenance of the restaurant can be obtained by referring to the daily, weekly cleaning schedule. As a cast member of Chuck E. Cheese’s team, you are about to have many good times and make many new friends. But now it’s time to go to work, and there are some general guide lines you should know for both kitchen and service general. First, be on time, punctuality is extremely important to a well run facility. Know the correct usage of the time clock, and understand all break time rules. For general safety and security: no trash is to be taken out after dark, girls must walk to their cars in groups of 3 or 4 after dark, be aware of specific parking areas, and always be in proper cast member uniform. Remember, do not chew gum while working. Make sure you have been informed of, and understand, the whereabouts and safety instructions concerning all hazardous materials ,such as cleaning products, used in your store. Know the location and usage of the fire extinguisher. Begin each shift by thoroughly washing your hands, paying close attention to your nails, and wash your hands frequently while you’re at work. As a Chuck E. Cheese’s cast member, you are required to know your facility. Recognize the location of the salad bar, beverage bar, gameroom, restrooms, trash cans, smoking areas, and other important features. Some restaurants are equipped with smoking areas, be sure you are aware of these and politely ask all guests to observe them. For trash disposal: remove the full trash can from the trash can holder and take it to the holding area in the kitchen, remove the inner liner and tie at the top, then place the bags into the large trash container and re-line the plastic bins with a fresh liner, replace into the thank you bin. Once a week the trash holders and cans are to be brought back to a designated area for cleaning. Flush the can with water and scrub the necessary areas, then rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry. Wet mopping is used in all areas. First, sweep the floors and pick up all the loose dust and soil. Fill the first bucket with hot detergent solution and the other with hot water. Clean with the solution, paying attention to trouble areas, then rinse with the hot water. Magic clean is everyone’s responsibility. This means when any area of the restaurant is out of order, especially the front of the store, the problem is solved like magic! Just keep your eyes open and be on your toes, this will help each shift go more smoothly. Begin your shift by checking the dining area, and continue to check it throughout the day. Clean all the booths and tables. Clean the booths by removing the table and cleaning the seats thoroughly, including the cracks. Use a toy broom to clean the area, then vacuum the area. Make sure the vacuum is set at the proper height, and the bags are empty or changed daily. Replace the table into the booth. Take the time to adjust all the signage and artifacts. If you can reach it, it must be cleaned. At all times, a cast member is to be assigned the responsibility of checking the restrooms on a 15 minute basis to ensure they meet sanitation standards. Use the restroom checklist as a guideline for checking and cleaning. Here are a few examples, wipe down the mirror area including: sinks, tile, and chrome. Clean the toilets and urinals using the correct cleaning items and proper techniques. Always be through, spot wash any dirty areas on the restroom floors. Now let’s talk about servicing the guests. During the peak times, a cast member should be greeting our guests at the front door. This is the guest’s first impression of our restaurant, smile and introduce them to Chuck E. Cheese’s! To clean the entry glass, begin with a spray bottle filled with water and glass cleaner. Be sure it is labeled properly. Now, wipe down the glass until it’s clean and free of streaks using a ?? towel. For running orders check the ticket against the pizza delivery chart. Take the food to the table as soon as possible, to ensure its freshness. Serve each pizza with a big greeting and a smile. When delivering an order, always interact with the guest and let them know you are glad they’re here at Chuck E. Cheese’s! Once the guests have had a chance to begin their meal, stop by the table to check on their food and see if they need anything. Pre-bus the table by offering to take away any trash or finished food items. Box any left over items the guest wants to take home at the table. Be sure to interact with them and let them know you’re glad to see them at Chuck E. Cheese’s. Immediately after the guests leave the table, bus it by removing all leftover food and trash items. Wipe down the table, making sure you wipe behind the napkin holder. Clean the condiment containers and the napkin holder, and arrange per standards. This is also a good time to check and see if the condiments need refilling. If you can see light through the container, they must be filled. The salt and pepper shakers are to be cleaned daily, and on a weekly basis the cheese and red pepper shakers should be run through the sink machine, dried, and refilled. Now the beverage bar. At opening, completely stock the area with required items like straws, lids, and condiments. Always remember to clean and sanitize the entire counter surface. Clean and replace soda dispensing heads. Sanitize the automatic ice dispenser and fill with ice. Make coffee and iced tea, with one bag per gallon, just prior to opening. During open hours, check stock levels every 15 minutes and make fresh coffee frequently as needed. To close down the beverage bar, clean and sanitize the coffee machine, coffee pots, and the iced tea machine. Sanitize the soft drink towers and counter top, and clean the ice dispenser. Drain the pan and soda dispensing heads. Empty the trash, sweep and mop the floor. It is your responsibility to be aware of the cleanliness of all the floor areas. This includes the dining room, salad bar, beverage bar, game room, and the ball crawl.

Hey Helen, how's it going?

**Helen Henny: (Walkaround)**

Great Todd! Y’know when everyone works together it leaves me much more time to do the part of my job I like best, making magic for our guests! Right?

**[Employee gives thumbs up]**

**Mr. Munch: (Walkaround)**

What was that?

**Todd Horchner:**

Kitchen general is not only important to ensure cleanliness and sanitation, but employee safety as well.

**Chuck E Cheese: (Voiceover)**

In kitchen general you also have many responsibilities. Beginning and ending each shift with a clean kitchen is extremely important. Make sure all areas are completely clean and sanitized. All stainless steel must be wiped down, including the pizza make table. Sweep the floors, making sure you move large items and sweep behind them thoroughly. Also pay special attention to cleaning the base boards. For mopping the floors, begin by making a soap mix. While mopping, always be thorough and use caution on the wet floors. Setting up the make table may be your responsibility, be sure you know the correct procedure. Always make sure the can opener is clean and in good working order. Organizing the dish area will keep your kitchen clean and running smoothly. Fill the first sink with hot detergent solution. Fill the second sink with warm rinse water and the third sink with cold sanitizer solution. Clean the dishes thoroughly in the three compartment sink, then place them on the dish rack and run them through the dish washer. In kitchen general you will be exposed to a variety of new utensil items, be sure you know the proper uses and cleaning of each. Proper inventory control is essential to ensure that quality and freshness are maintained. Labeling of shelves will make inventory control and recording easier and more efficient. A specific area for each item makes location easy. After all food orders are received, date each item. Place on appropriately labeled shelf in the following order: new to the back, old to the front. New to the bottom, old to the top. These procedures apply to the walk-in area as well. You may be asked to change out the soda syrup, this is done by disengaging the tube from the empty container and attaching it to the full one. For pan cleaning, thoroughly scrub all pizza pans in a detergent solution using a green scouring pad. Rinse thoroughly and place in the dishwasher as necessary. Teamwork is a big part of working in the kitchen. Always be available to give your fellow employee a hand with any difficult tasks. For kitchen and service general you will have many responsibilities! You’ve now been shown an overview of the expectations and procedures of each job, now ask your trainer any questions you may have. Also practice and study your materials to further your knowledge on the positions. Have fun and good luck!

**Todd Horchner:**
A key element in kitchen general is teamwork! Hey Munch, thanks for helping out!

**Mr. Munch: (Walkaround)**
Hey hey, no problem Todd! I enjoyed it, but isn’t it time for a pizza break? I’m starving! Heh heh.
