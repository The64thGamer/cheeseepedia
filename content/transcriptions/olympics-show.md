I'll be bigger than Fat Albert

And Elvis Presley too

Don't you ever get smart with me boy

Or I might sit on you

I'll get stuck in every doorway and they'll have to blast me free

When I double in size

Double in size

Every single part of me will double in size

I triple in size

Then triple in size

Every single part of me will triple in size

Quadruple in size

Quadruple in size

And when you see me boys and girls you won't believe your eyes

**Beach Bear: (singing)**

The nights are tough yea

They're long and cold

I shiver and shake from my head down to my toes

Cover me

I'm begging for your mercy

Cover me

And he always pulls the covers off of me

So cover me

Every night I freeze to death

Every night I suffer and its

All because my goofy little brother

Cover me

I'm turnin' blue now cover me

I gotta sleep with little brother

And he always pulls the covers off of me

Cover me

I gotta sleep with little brother

And he always pulls the covers off of me

Ah please I'm turnin' blue

I gotta sleep with little brother

And he always pulls the covers off of me-heee

Oh-hooo

**[Song: Lucille (parody)]**


**Billy Bob: (singing)**

Well I knew I found true love

The day I met Beulah

Riding my bike home from school

I was cuttin' some peelies

And poppin' some wheelies

And makin' her think I was cool

Then that doggone nut broke

And busted out my spokes

My goodness, I thought I was dead

Then Beulah came runnin'

She thought I was a funnin'

That's what I looked at my bike and I said

You picked a fine time to leave me loose wheel

**Billy Bob & Beach Bear: (singing)**

Showin' off my old and big bicyclin' skills

**Billy Bob: (singing)**

I could've won it, but now you've done done it

**Billy Bob, Beach Bear, & Mitzi Mozzarella: (singing)**

You picked a fine time to leave me loose wheel
