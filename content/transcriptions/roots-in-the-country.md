**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Alright listen up! Pizza Time Theatre presents a little country picket. 

**Pasqually:**

We gonna bring out that a- cotton picking canine.  

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

The country singingest dog that ever stepped up to a microphone, or a fire hydrant. 

**Pasqually:**

Your favorite doggy and mine, Jasper T. Jowls! 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Now folks call me lazy without any fail 

Cuz I'm slow as molasses and quick as a snail

They think cause I'm slowed down the future ain't mine

But let me tell you that suits me just fine 

**Jasper T. Jowls & The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Got my roots in the country 

 And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Got an edge on tomorrow cuz I'm happy today

Don't expect nothing extra, I live longer that way 

I ain't in no hurry to race up to the top 

Cuz once you get up there it's one very far drop

**All: (Singing)**

Got my roots in the country 

And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yeeeeeha ha ha ha ha! Woo! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

All right pick that thing, pick it! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yahoo! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That's the way to do it! That's right there! 

**Pasqually:**

All right, all right, that's a- nice! That's a- nice!

**Mr. Munch:**

He should keep playing!

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I went to the city and I saw people pushing fast

They got to keep running to stay ahead of the past

Rushing past boundaries that lead em to nowhere 

They ain't nothing doing and never get there

**All: (Singing)**

Got my roots in the country 

My feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Yeah!

**All: (Singing)**

Got my roots in the country 

And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

**[Jasper howls]**

**All: (Singing)**

Got my roots in the country 

And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

Got my roots in the country 

And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

Got my roots in the country 

And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

Got my roots in the country 

And my feet on the ground 

Not worrying about tomorrow 

Makes me one smart hound 

**[Everyone cheers]**
