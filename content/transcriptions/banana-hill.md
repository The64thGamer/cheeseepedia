**All: (Singing)**

Oh woh oh

Oh woh oh

**Fatz Geronimo: (Singing)**

I found my thrill 

On Banana Hill 

**All: (Singing)**

Buh banana

Buh banana

**Fatz Geronimo: (Singing)**

And oh, what a thrill

Mm! 

When I found you

**All: (Singing)**

Buh banana nana hill 

**Fatz Geronimo:**

She had that look

Straight from Jungle Book

**All: (Singing)**

Buh banana 

Buh banana

**Fatz Geronimo:**

And that's all it took

I love you 

**All: (Singing)**

Buh banana nana hill 

**Fatz Geronimo:**

And now I'm swinging through the trees yeah

Do anything to please ya 

A- since you left me all alone 

The jungle's been my home 

I- I love you 

I found my thrill 

On Banana Hill 

**All: (Singing)**

Buh banana 

Buh banana

**Fatz Geronimo:**

And now I swing from tree to tree

I hope that you'll see me 

I give you anything 

Cause you're my 'rangutan

So say that you'll be mine 

And we'll share a swinging vine baby

**Fatz Geronimo:**

Uh- uh- uh- uh- who loves you baby?
