<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
Howdy folks, I'm Billy Bob. That's three B's, two L's, a I, a Y, and a O. (laughs)
<br>
Its real nice yall could drop in on me today, things gets kinda quiet here at Smitty's Super Service Station sometimes. What with the gas sit-i-ation the way it is n' all.<sup>(1)</sup> We've had to stop selling gasoline altogether.
<br>
Once it got past twenty five cent a gallon, I didn't have no more friends what could afford it no-how. But... things'll be alright soon- (worrysome)
<br>
Cause, as you can see, I'm making up a new fangled formula down here on the floor. (excitedly)
<br>
Yeah its made of lots of good stuff and its in this little container and its gets all boiled up n' everything, and it comes out this long tube...
<br><br>
<b>[Billy Bob plays his guitar strings higher then lower in pitch while explaining]</b>
<br><br>
All the way down into this barrel, and I call it Gas-O-Hol. Yeah, we can use it in our car, or drink it!
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob & Looney Bird: (singing)</b>
<br>
And havin' such a wonderful day
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
Hey there Looney Bird! (excitedly)
<br><br>
<b>Looney Bird:</b>
<br>
Hey there Billy Bob! (screaming)
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
Folks, I'd like ya to meet my friend here, this here's the Looney Bird!
<br><br>
<b>[Billy Bob twangs his guitar in a high pitch]</b>
<br><br>
I can't afford a watchdog, so Looney Bird here moved in to watch over my secret formula!
<br><br>
<b>[Another guitar twang]</b>
<br><br>
How much Gas-O-Hol we got so far Looney Bird?
<br><br>
<b>Looney Bird:</b>
<br>
Just a minute Billy Bob I'll go check and see!
<br><br>
<b>[Another guitar twang]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
Here's probably gonna measure real accurate like exactly how much Gas-O-Hol we got.
<br><br>
<b>[Guitar twangs in a worrying fashion]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Elongated slurping noises made by Looney Bird]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Guitar twangs drunkenly]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Looney Bird:</b>
<br>
We ain't got too much yet Billy Bob. (worried)
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
Oh dear.
<br><br>
<b>Looney Bird:</b>
<br>
I guess you better put on some more corn squeezin's huh Billy Bob?
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
Yeah I guess I better. I just hope the Looney Bird don't become some kinda Gas-O-Holic.
Hey Looney Bird, its time for your favorite part of the show! (excitedly)
<br><br>
<b>Looney Bird:</b>
<br>
You mean its time to go already-?
<br><br>
<b>Billy Bob:</b>
<br>
No! I mean its time to get down and get funky- sort of.
