**Jasper T. Jowls:**

We folks from the south know all about fast cars!

**[Song: G.T.O]**


**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Little GTO, you're really lookin' fine

Three deuces and a four-speed and a 389

Listen to her tachin' up now, listen to her why-ee-eye-ine

I'm the coolest thing around, little buddy gonna shut you down

When I turn it on, wind it up, blow it out GTO

Wow!

**Pasqually:**

Y'know, I had a really hot car one time Chuck E.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah well I hope you gave it back before they caught ya.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Haha! Not that kinda hot! Haha!

**[Song: Custom Machine]**


**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Well she's metal flake blue with a corvette mill

**Pasqually & The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Check my custom machine

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

And they say it looks better when she's standin' still

**Pasqually & The Warblettes: (Singing)**

Check my custom machine

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Oh well when you hear her go chugga chugga down the street 

I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ok boys lets rev em' up!

**[Car revving]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You boys move on out, follow the Big C if you can

**[Song: Born to be Wild]**


**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Get your motor runnin'

Head out on the highway

Lookin' for adventure

And whatever comes our way

**All: (Singing)**

You're gonna go make it happen

Check it out, it's a driving race

Fire up on the bikes, lets move on

Explode into space

Born to be wild!

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk

**All: (Singing)**

Born to be wild!
