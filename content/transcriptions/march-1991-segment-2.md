Yo

 **Chuck**

 Lay down a beat right about here. Yeah, now check this out. The band is gonna be the DJ’s and 
we’re gonna let all the kids tell us what they’re gonna he when they grow up 

**Jasper:**

 I’m not sure I know how to do the DJ part 

**All:** 

Yeah 

**Chuck**

 Come on, it’s a piece of cheese. Yo Taylor and Maggie please step up to that mic and tell us 
when you start to work what your job is gonna be like 

**Maggie:**

 Supersonic travel sure appeals to me. I'll be a super cool supersonic pilot, you see 

**Taylor:**

 I'm gonna make my mark in the computer game. When IBM needs help they'll be calling my name 

**All:** 

Sit across beyond the stars and fly there on a dream. They said you couldn't go that far 

**Kids:**

 There's nothing you can't do if you decide you want to 


Helen: Hunter and Conita it's your turn to take the stage. What's it gonna be when you finally 
come of age?

** Hunter:** 

When I go to work I'll be a pain attacker. You'll see me on the field as an NFL linebacker 

**Conita:**

 Beautiful creations are sculpted by my hands. You'll see my works of art all across this land 

**Pasqually:** 

Garrett and Amanda, we're perking up our ears to find out what the two of you will be doing in a few years 

**Garrett:** 

Scholastic pursuits keep my mind from going stale, so I think I'll take a gig at Harvard or Yale 

**Amanda:** 

My fans will wait in like to get a glimpse of me, you’ll see my name in lights on a Broadway marquee 

**All:** 

Sit across beyond the stars and fly there on a dream. They said you couldn't go that far 

**Kids:** There's nothing you can't do if you decide you want to 

**Jasper:** Rappin' Jasper Jowls, your main emcee and there's Megan and Mark who wish to rap with me 

**Megan:** 

When I tell you my goals you best believe I meant it, cause I'll see you on the floor of the United States senate 

**Mark:** 

There's a lot of sick people who need a helping hand. I'm gonna go to school and be a medical man 


**All:** 

Sit across beyond the stars and fly there on a dream. They said you couldn't go that far 

**Kids:** 

There's nothing you can't do if you decide you want to 

**Pasqually:** 

Helen Henny 

Helen: Yes? 

**Pasqually:** 

The kids and I were talking about goals and I was wondering 

Munch: 

I know all about em. You kick the ball through the upright, you slide the puck past the 
goal, you throw the ball through the hoop 

**Chuck**

 Munch, Munch, no Munch not that kind of goal 


**Jasper:** 

You know I think they’re talking about the kind of goal that’s in your heart, not on a 
scoreboard

Helen: 

I think I know what you mean. I saw a kid dancing to the beat, you might've thought he 
had two left feet. But he kept at it and after a while, the other kids were trying to copy his style. 
Now there's a guy who don't believe in quitting. He kept at it cause he knew he had


**All:** 

Possibilities. Possibilities. I see it on your face, you're going places. Possibilities. 
Possibilities. You've got possibilities 

**Jasper:** 

Let me tell you about a guy I know. My friend Pasqually is a drumming man. He wasn't 
born with those sticks in his hand

 **Pasqually:** 

I practiced till my little fingers were blue, to learn to play that's what you gotta do 

**Helen:** 

Oh yeah 

**Pasqually:**

 I didn't mind, I was having fun. It feels good to make the most of your 

**All:**

 Possibilities. Possibilities. I see it on your face, you're going places. Possibilities. 
Possibilities. You've got possibilities 

**Chuck**

 Ok, listen to this. A little girl was staring at her shoes, she told me that she had some bad news. 
It seems her kitten wasn't feeling right but three days later he was smiling bright. Cause girls 
and kittens don't feel bad for long, when you're that long you've got a lot of

 **All:**

 Possibilities. Possibilities. I see it on your face, you're going places. Possibilities. 
Possibilities. We got possibilities 

**Chuck**

 Does this make any sense? 

**Kids:** 

We think we know what you’re trying to say 

**Chuck**

 Oh yeah? 

**Kids:**

 If we keep at it we’ll be on our way

**Chuck**

 You got it 

**Kids:**

 We’ll stick together and we’ll make some noise 

**Chuck** 

Let’s hear it 

**Kids:** 

You're gonna hear from us girls and boys 

**All:** 

Yeah! 

**Chuck**

 If anybody says “You can’t do it.” 

**Kids:**

 We’ll know better cause we know we have 

**All:**

 Possibilities. Possibilities. I see it on your face, you’re going places. Possibilities. 
Possibilities. You’ve got possibilities. 

**Chuck** 

Yeah! 

**All:** 

Possibilities. Possibilities. I see it on your face, you’re going places. Possibilities. 
Possibilities. We’ve got possibilities 

**Chuck**

 And with so many possibilities out there you can do whatever you want. Don’t go too far, we’ll 
be right back
