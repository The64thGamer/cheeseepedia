**[Guitar intro]**


**Announcer:**

Ladies and gentlemen.
Only once in a lifetime does a man come along with such unquestionable talent and persistence- that he cannot be denied.
People, I'd like you to give a warm welcome- a warm ShowBiz welcome, to your favorite rockabilly relative.
Uncle Klunk.

**[Song: Better All Over]**


**Uncle Klunk: (singing)**

Fell better all Over
More than anywhere else, baby
When I'm around you
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
When you kiss me like you do
Well am as wild as a buck
Everytime you call me up
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else when you
Anytime you're near
Well my heart beats double time
When you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel

**[Guitar solo]**


Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
When you hold me in your arms
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
When you thrill me with your charms
Well I di-ji-di-ji-diddle
I'm as fit as a fiddle
You makes me wanna kick up my heels
Well I feel better all over
More than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel
Well that's exactly how I feel
Well that's exactly how I feel
