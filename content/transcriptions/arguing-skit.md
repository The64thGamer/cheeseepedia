**Billy Bob:**

Well howdy'do folks and welcome back to the show here at ShowBiz Pizza Place. Now it's been said that we here at ShowBiz are known for goin' that extra mile in terms of bringing you, the customer, quality entertainment while you're feastin' yourselves on assorted delicious cullinary delights.

**Fatz:**

Uh, w-w-w-what you talkin' about Billy Bob.

**Earl:**

Uh Fatz I belive Billy Bob is tryin' a say that the management pays us to bang out a few songs while the folks out there shovels pizza down their throats.

**Fatz:**

Ban- Bang out songs? Who- who who's bangin' out songs?

**Earl:**

Yeah.

**Beach Bear:**

Well- well actually I think they had gorilla fingers in mind when they were- talking about banging.

**Fatz:**

Huh? I never- I don't bang. I don't- I would'a- had forty years of music college!

**[Dook & Mitzi Laugh]**


**Beach Bear:**

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

**[Mitzi Laughs]**


But- I mean y'know.

**Fatz:**

**Beach Bear:**

**Dook:**

**[Fatz & Dook Laugh]**


**Fatz:**
