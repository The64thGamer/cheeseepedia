**Announcer:**

Presenting the exciting new sensation of stage and screen, here's your bucktooth buddy Chuck E. Cheese!

**[Song: You Got It (The Right Stuff)]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That's me! Chuck E. Cheese! Your musical master of ceremonies! Now, since the band and I are really excited about being the new kids on the block here, we'd like to do a song by the New Kids On The Block. So let's take off, with The Right Stuff!

**[Rocket Launch Sound Effect]**


**Jasper T. Jowls: (singing)**

First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love

**Jasper and Backup Singers: (singing)**

Now I hope it lasts

**Jasper T. Jowls: (singing)**

I can see it in your walk
Tell 'em when you talk
See it in everything you

**[Song: I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ha ha okay, okay! And now, it's my pleasure to present the sweetest songbird on the stage, ladies and gentlemen, Helen Henny!

**Helen Henny:**

Thanks, Chuck E.! Y'know, we're all new here, and it's fun! But for me it's also just a little bit scary trying to make new friends, so here's a song that I hope will make us friends, right now!

**Helen Henny: (singing)**

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

**Helen and Backup: (singing)**

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

**Helen Henny: (singing)**

With somebody who loves me

**Helen and Backup: (singing)**

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

**Helen Henny: (singing)**

With somebody who loves me
Ooh Ooh!

**Backup:**

Dance!

**Helen Henny:**

Oh Chuck E.! I need someone to dance with!

**Backup:**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
