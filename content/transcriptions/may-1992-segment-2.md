**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

Well baby let me be your loving teddy bear. 

Put a chain around my neck 

and leave me anywhere. 

Oh, let me be your teddy bear. 

I don’t wanna be your tiger 

cause tigers play too rough,

I don’t wanna be your lion 

cause lions aren’t the kind you love enough. 

I just wanna be your teddy bear. 

Put a chain around my neck 

and leave me anywhere. 

Oh, let me be your teddy bear.

Well baby let me be around you every night. 

Run your fingers through my hair and comfort me real tight. 

Oh, let me be your teddy bear. 

Now listen, I don’t wanna be your tiger 

cause tigers play too rough, 

I don’t wanna be your lion 

cause lions aren’t the kind you love enough. 

I just wanna be your teddy bear. 

Put a chain around my neck 

and leave me anywhere. 

Oh, let me be your teddy bear. 

Oh, let me be your teddy bear. 

I just wanna be your teddy bear

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well Munch, judging from the sound reverberating throughout, it could only be one
person

**Chuck E. Cheese & Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Charlie Rockit!

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Yo, what’s up?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Well Charlie, I’d like to ask you to sit in but-

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Gee Munch, that teddy bear stuff I just can’t relate

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

What on earth do you mean?

**Charlie Rockit:** 

I mean, I like tunes with a little more bite

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Well Charlie, I’m sure we’d all like to hear that but we got a show to do

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

one two, one two. 

I remember when rock was young, 

me and Suzie had so much fun.

Holding hands and skimming stones. 

Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own 

but the biggest kick I ever got 

was doing the thing called the crocodile rock. 

While the other kids were rocking round the clock, 

we were hopping and bopping to the crocodile rock

**All:(Singing)** 

Crocodile rocking

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Was something shocking when your feet just can’t keep still

**All:(Singing)** 

I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will. Lordy mama

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Those Friday nights when all the stars were shining bright

**All:(Singing)** 

The crocodile rocking

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Was out of sight

**All:(Singing)** 

Well the years went by and the rock just died. 

Suzie went and left me for some foreign guy.

Long nights crying by the record machine 

dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans. 

But they’ll never kill the thrills we got 

burning up to the crocodile rock

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Learning fast as the weeks went past

**All:(Singing)** 

We really thought the crocodile rock would last. 

Well, crocodile rocking

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Was something shocking when your feet just can’t keep still

**All:(Singing)** 

I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will

**All:(Singing)** 

Lordy mama

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Those Friday nights when all the stars were shining bright

**All:(Singing)** 

And crocodile rocking

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Was out of sight

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

I can now understand, Charlie, what you mean by a song with bite. But we really need to get along with our show. So, uh

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Not quite, Chuck

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

What?

**Charlie Rockit:** 

You were saying?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Forget it
