**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s showtime everybody, and to make it a magical show, we’re gonna set the stage using
your imagination. Make believe it’s a warm autumn night, add a sky filled with stars, now add a
big romantic moon, and finally, add the rhythm of the night

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

When it feels like the world is on your shoulders 

and all of the madness has got you going crazy. 

It's time to get out, step out into the street 

where all of the action is right there at your feet. 

Well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away 

underneath electric stars

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Just come with me

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

And we can

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Shake your blues right away

What are you doing over there, Mr. Munch?

**Mr. Munch:**

Well, I’m just trying to count up all the interesting names of the kids that I meet here.
There must be a million of them

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Well a name is just a name. It’s the person behind it that makes the name special

**Mr. Munch:**

Why, you said it, buddy

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

I'm not the world's most worldly guy, 

but that's ok and I'll tell you why. 

Cause I've always got my good name

When people bug me I pay no mind. 

Their attitude doesn't ruin my time. 

Why should I care?

You can't take mine. 

No one trends on my good name. 

Cause I've earned it and I'm proud of my good name. 

Whatever may come, for good or for bad 

I'm proud of the fact that I'll always have a good name.
