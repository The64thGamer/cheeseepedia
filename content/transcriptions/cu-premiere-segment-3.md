Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, here comes the new group that’s all the rage live on stage! Chuck E. Cheese and Munch’s Make Believe Band!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**  

Folks! From the tingle in my spine, I know one of two tingles. Either I got my tail in a light socket, or, it’s showtime!

**Mr. Munch:**  

Well it’s not showtime.

**Pasqually The Chef:**  

It’s not?

**Mr. Munch:**  

It’s meal time!

**[Chomping Sounds]**


**Mr. Munch:**  

I’m wasting away here!

**Helen Henny:**  

Oh, sure.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**  

Munch, you ate eleven pizzas an hour ago!

**Mr. Munch:**

Well okay, I do have large bones.

Oh good. Thank you, because I have just received a special bulletin that there is a foot loose in the audience!

**Pasqually The Chef: (singing)**  

Been working so hard  
I'm punching my card  
Eight hours, for what?  
Oh, tell me what I got  
I've got this feeling  
That time's just holding me down  
I'll hit the ceiling  
Or else I'll tear up this town  
So now I gotta cut loose

**All: (singing)**  

Footloose  
Kick off your Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise  
Pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back  
Come on before we crack  
Lose your blues

Everybody cut footloose!
