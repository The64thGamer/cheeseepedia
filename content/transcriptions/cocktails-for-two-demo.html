<b>Chuck E. Cheese:</b>
<br>
Step right up, step right up, doctor Chuck E. Cheese here. Tonight I got a real special for ya. Its our organic pizza, filled with vitamins L, O, V, and E. Fellas, its garunteed to get ya up, and keep ya up.
<br><br>
<b>Pasqually:</b>
<br>
Ey boss! I know a girl who didn't-a have-a my organic pizza, she fell apart at the seams!
<br><br>
<b>[Chuck Laughs]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Chuck E. Cheese:</b>
<br>
Was she a loose woman?
<br><br>
<b>[Chuck & Pasqually Laugh]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Pasqually:</b>
<br>
Ey everybody! Step up to the bar, and have a drink, or two, or three! And you can get as high as we are- up on our wall!
<br><br>
<b>Chuck E. Cheese:</b>
<br>
Then sit back and relax in this secluded rendezvous
<br><br>
<b>[Song: Cocktails for Two]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Crusty: (singing)</b>
<br>
In some secluded rendezvous
<br><br>
<b>[Someone Shouts Whoopee]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Whistle Blown]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Gunshot]</b>
<br><br>
That overlooks the avenue
<br><br>
<b>[Horns Blow]</b>
<br><br>
With someone sharing a delightful character
<br><br>
<b>[Someone Shouts 'Yickety Yickety']</b>
<br><br>
Of this and that with cocktails for two
<br><br>
<b>[Glasses Clink Twice]</b>
<br><br>
As we enjoy a cigarette
<br><br>
<b>[Wheeze, Cough]</b>
<br><br>
To some exquisite chansonette
<br><br>
<b>[Brief Fiddle Plays]</b>
<br><br>
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath
<br>
The serviette with cocktails for two
<br><br>
<b>[Glasses Clink Twice]</b>
<br><br>
My head may go reeling
<br><br>
<b>[Slide Whistle]</b>
<br><br>
But my heart will be obedient
<br><br>
<b>[Heartbeat Twice]</b>
<br><br>
With intoxicating kisses for
<br>
The principal ingredient
<br><br>
<b>[Pop, Carbonated Fizz, Laughter]</b>
<br><br>
Most any afternoon at five
<br><br>
<b>[Four Tings]</b>
<br><br>
We'll be so glad we're both alive
<br><br>
<b>[Breath, Sigh]</b>
<br><br>
Then maybe fortune will complete the plan
<br>
That all began with cocktails for two 
<br><br>
<b>[Glasses Clink, Glasses Break]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Extended Gulping, Spits, and Hiccups]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Musical Outro]</b>
<br><br>
<b>[Audience Applause]</b>
