**Steve White: (Singing)**

In deepest, darkest Africa, 

a mystery was found. 

There was music in the jungle. 

When no one was around 

Where it could be coming from, 

no one really knew. 

So, we started a safari 

to see what we could do. 

Walking through the wilderness further every day. 

It gets a little scary when you do not know the way. 

Watching out for wildebeest, confronting crocodiles, 

following the jungle sun for miles and miles. 

We were very tired. 

This was no vacation. 

We decided that the music 

must have been imagination. 

Then when we least expected it, 

the jungle drums pounded. 

They came from all around us. 

Help! We're Surrounded!

When the jungle drums beat, 

you turn up the heat. 

Your feet could lead you anywhere. 

Gorillas on the congo are beating on the bongo. 

When monkeys start to swing, it's a jungle out there. 

I wouldn't quite believe it if I wasn't there to see 

the animals were putting on a jungle jamberee, 

playing every instrument, making every sound. 

Rocking so hard it short shook the ground. 

We wanted to get out of there. 

Didn't feel like staying. 

The animals were everywhere. 

And here's what they were playing. 

There were chimpanzees on timpanis. 

Zebras on the xylophones, 

hyenas on ocarinas, 

and tigers on the trombones. 

There were elephants trumpeting, 

gibbons on guitar, 

a boa on the squeeze box, 

and hear that lion roar. 

When the jungle drums beat, 

you turn up the heat. 

Your feet could lead you anywhere. 

Gorillas on the Congo are beating on the bongo. 

When monkeys start to swing, it's a jungle out there. 

The giraffe could hit the high notes. 

The snakes played scales. 

The anteater had hot licks. 

You should have heard them whale. 

The rhinos played their horns 

on this musical trip. 

Flamingos did fandangos 

while the hippos shook their hips. 

When the jungle drums beat, 

they turn up the heat. 

Your feet could lead you anywhere. 

Gorillas on the congo are beating on the bongo. 

When monkeys start to swing, it's a jungle out there. 

It was such a crazy party like a musical zoo. 

We couldn't keep from dancing. 

And you should dance, too. 

Cuz when you least expect it, 

the drums could start pounding. 

And you'd better start to boogie with these animals surrounding. 

When the jungle drums beat, 

they turn up the heat. 

Your feet could lead you anywhere. 

Gorillas on the Congo are beating on the bongo. 

When monkeys start to swing, it's a jungle out there. 

Gorillas on the Congo are beating on the bongo. 

When monkeys start to swing, it's a jungle out there.

Okay.
