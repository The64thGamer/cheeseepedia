Y'know a lot of people ask why my chief pizza cook is also playin' the drums here.

**[Pasqually laughs]**


**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yeah

**[Band Chatters Quietly]**


**Chuck E. Cheese:**

The answer is that on the outside he's a pizza cook huh, but on the inside...

**[Heartbeat, Machine Hum]**


**Pasqually The Chef:**

Ta-da!

**Mr. Munch:**

I'll say!

**[Song: The Heart of Rock & Roll]**


**Pasqually The Chef: (singing)**

New York, New York, is everything they say
Ain't no place that I'd rather be

**Jasper T. Jowls: (singing)**

Where else can you do a half a million things
All at a quarter to three

**Helen Henny: (singing)**

When they play their music
Ooh their modern music
They play it with a lot of style

**Mr. Munch: (singing)**

But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
Really, really drives 'em wild
Ha ha ha!

**All: (singing)**

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em

**Pasqually The Chef: (singing)**

Now the old boy may be barely breathing

**All: (singing)**

But the heart of rock and roll
Heart of rock and roll is still beating

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ha ha! And now, to beef up the band, here's the Bullhorns!

**Jasper T. Jowls: (singing)**

Bands with a million styles

**Mr. Munch: (singing)**

But it's still that same old rock and roll music
That really, really drives 'em wild

**All: (singing)**

T-t-t-t-t-they say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em

**Pasqually The Chef: (singing)**
