A Ronald animatronic is set to go live for auctioning on May 3rd, part of the original {{< wiki-link "Ronald McDonald in a Hot Air Balloon" >}} line of store displays made by Setmakers and AVG Technologies in 1984. Its said a few were created- but only one has been confirmed from Glendale, CO.
The starting bid is at $500, though its original appraisal back in 1999 was $2k-3k, which is set as its expected price on the site. The animatronic did have a showtape that is currently fully lost, but it is not included in this auction.
