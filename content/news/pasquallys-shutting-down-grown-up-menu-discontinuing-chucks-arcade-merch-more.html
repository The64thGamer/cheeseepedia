On March 21, 2025, CEC would internally announce changes set over the coming months.<sup>(1)</sup> First would be the shutting down of Pasqually's Pizza & Wings at the end of the month, which was an online delivery service started in March of 2020 for CEC restaurants to compete and stay open during COVID 19. The service would receive criticism at the time for following the ghost kitchen trend, where its rebranded name would obscure that customers were buying from CEC (Often in the public considered to be lower quality pizza than usual delivery offerings). CEC would claim this was unintentional, but never rebranded the service to fit customer expectations. Pasqually's exclusive delivery offerings were later moved to the Grown-Up Menu in 2023 to be available in-store.<sup>(2)</sup>

The second announcement was also the discontinuation of the Grown-Up Menu- set for mid to late April of 2025. This also includes the Chile Lime Rub and Korean BBQ Wings. They are countering this by changing the color of their Dippin' Dots and passing it off as a new menu item.<sup>(1)</sup>

More news came from various internal discussions, including plans to launch classic Chuck E. Cheese merchandise at {{< wiki-link "Chuck's Arcade" >}}. It is unclear what this will be, rumoring from just t-shirts to new-old stock of classic prize counter items from storage. Additionally, the test of Bella's Snack Shop at {{< wiki-link "Garland, TX (4992 State Hwy 190)" >}}, which is a snack stand consisting of popcorn, churros, nachos, and pretzels, has been delayed in further rollout for unknown reasons. It was originally set to test further at the beginning of the month, though it has seemingly not cancelled as corporate is still mentioning the test.<sup>(1)</sup>
