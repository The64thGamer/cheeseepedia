The full showtape, uncut, of {{< wiki-link "Skit-Oink 3 Tunnel/Love W/XMAS">}} with signals is <a href= "https://archive.org/details/ptt_showtape_reels_w_signals">now available</a>. The <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQe5Yq_8BJA">uncut audio</a> is also available on YouTube. Previously it was only ever chopped up with signals improperly decoded on Program Blue. Thanks to RockafireFan123 for the rip.
