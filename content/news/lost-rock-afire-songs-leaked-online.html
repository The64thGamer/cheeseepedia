A new set of lost Rock-afire songs were leaked by YBP on February 25th, consisting of various 90's segments- and a lost segment from the {{< wiki-link "Celebration Birthday Tape" >}}. The rips of the tapes are by RockafireFan123:
<ul>
<li>Stevie's Birthday (Celebration Tape)</li>
<li>Turtle Power</li>
<li>American Pie</li>
<li>Shake Your Tail Feathers</li>
<li>You Got the Right Stuff</li>
</ul>
The segments had been in circulation by a small group for a few years, before finally being uploaded by YBP to YouTube. Others followed with files of uncompressed audio. There was a bit a fuss with the songs being uploaded, as they like almost every single Rock-afire show that has been uploaded in the past 20 years comes from a set of countless items that Snapper stole from Creative Engineering's warehouse in the 2000's, still being passed around and sold by Snapper. While Aaron Fechter has publicly decried acquirement of these stolen materials, he has never litigated any involved in the two decades since. Many lost materials are still exclusively on these items in circulation, and are likely to continue being slowly leaked piece by piece for years to come.

Update: as of February 28th, another lost 90's segment has been uploaded by Pikalove, "Down on the Corner".
