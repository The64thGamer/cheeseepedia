CEC Announced on December 9th it would be setting out plans to expand its stores to the United Kingdom, noting the UK's "expanding redemption game market". CEC stated that both the UK and Europe are now key markets for the brand.
Six stores are planned, being in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, and Bristol. Within these areas the chain is looking for shopping centers, retail parks, and leisure parks with car park frontage. The locations will be between 10,760 - 16,145 sqft and an eaves height above 13.1ft. Locations will be in areas with more than 25,000 kids under 12yo within a 20 minute drive. Wright Property will be overseeing the expansion.
CEC also announced its planned expansion into the South American country of Guyana. Multiple stores are planned, with J's Group of Companies being the franchisee for the endeavor.
