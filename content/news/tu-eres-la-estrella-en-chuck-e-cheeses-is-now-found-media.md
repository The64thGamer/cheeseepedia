On February 4th, the lost Spanish version of Birthday Star '92, which played in Chile up to 2008, was uploaded by CEC Fanchile to YouTube<sup>(1)</sup>
While snippets of the live show have been heard in home videos, no full rendition or rip of the audio was heard until this week. The live show has been known for a long time to have been released on a cassette in Chile in the mid 1990's as {{< wiki-link "Tu Eres La Estrella En Chuck E. Cheese's" >}}, meaning it was eventually going to surface online. One copy was found in 2020, but was gatekept and not released. On January 30th, 2025, CECFanchile would announce they had also obtained a copy and was preparing to rip it, where it is now found media after all these years.
The hope is for one day to have the proper showtape versions of the live with signals surface online, though with the extremely limited copies of the tapes compared to North America's variants, it's likely they are lost to time.
