National Bobblehead Hall of Fame & Museum is releasing a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} Singing Bobble Head set, alongside a standalone Rockstar Chuck bobblehead, for Preorder.
The MMBB set is $75 while the Chuck is $30. They are set to ship by July, though an article on them states they're set for April. This is one of the first pieces of merchandise to be directly of the CEC animatronics, rather than the characters.
CEC confirmed later in the day that the songs played through the stage are "Let's Have a Party", "Together We've Got It", and "Chuck E.'s Place".
