Today, David Mckillips and Mark Kupferman confirmed that the {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)" >}} would be keeping its animatronics through the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, making it the sixth of the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}. The store hosts the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}, rounding out the legacy lineup with another stage type. Kupferman commented on the store stating that they wanted to keep a stage in Canada, and given it was the last {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}} in existence it was a good fit.
<br>
Additionally, another Canadian store, {{< wiki-link "Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave)" >}}, will be keeping its special Pizza Time Theatre Chuck E. statue through its remodel, though it will not be keeping its 2-Stage.
