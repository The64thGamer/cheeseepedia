A current poll is being passed around the animatronics community to gather simple anonymous data and info about the composition of the community and their baseline interests. As of writing almost 350 responses are already in.
<ul>
    <li><a href = "https://forms.gle/TFX9yTTxA3yNU8Pp6">The Form</a></li>
    <li><a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZlKX0d2IKptBxjqMRj9doNDL8uSBQMzV4md6BJilYE/edit?usp=sharing">The Results</a> </li>
</ul>
The poll's results are fully public and open for analysis. 7 hours since the start of the poll it has garnered feedback about the questions asked to include more options and ones better fit for accurate assessments.

I am thinking about integrating polling into the site with better questions so the community can be polled frequently (like every quarter or 6 months) to start aggregating how things are going. Community reviews will eventually make it to articles as well so users can review stores, showtapes, characters, merchandise, food, ect.
