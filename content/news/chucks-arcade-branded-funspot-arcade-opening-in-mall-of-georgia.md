Chuck E. Cheese's Funspot Arcade initiative started in 2022 and has been reaching various mall locations throughout its run. The latest venture, being at the Mall of Georgia located in Buford, GA (3333 Buford Dr.), has propped up on their website under a new variant called {{< wiki-link "Chuck's Arcade" >}}. The logo features styles and character designs from the 80's branding- referred to as the "Classic" designs by CEC.
It is currently unclear if this will just be a standard Funspot with a different logo, or if it will be adorned with 80's arcade machines, decor, or potential fixtures from that era's Pizza Time Theatres. While Funspot has never been advertised directly by CEC, it will be interesting to see if this location will be used as a way to broaden the brand's image, or if it'll be merely something known only inside the fandom such as the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}.
