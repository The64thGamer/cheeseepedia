**Cheese-E-Pedia** is going under some format changes so that it is easier for users to edit the wiki and find information about their favorite locations! We're also heavy in transcribing showtapes and other media; more details below.

## Markdown comes to Cheese-E-Pedia! üéâ
Forget ```<b>bolding</b>``` text like this, when you can do ```**this**``` instead! We wanted to make sure that the editing experience was as simple as possible, so you don't need to learn HTML to write a page. So, here we are introducing **Markdown**. You might be familiar with Markdown from Discord -- so this should be a welcome change and a seamless one at that!

We'll be updating our {{< wiki-link "Contributor Home" >}} once the rollout is complete. You might see a few pages that don't look correct, and that's because we used a script to convert the pages. Feel free to edit any that are off! 

Markdown does not support all things, like underlining, or subscript, so you may need to still use HTML tags for those features.

You can use this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) as a reference in your journey to writing with Markdown! We hope that this makes things easier for you, especially when...

## Transcriptions are on a roll! üñäÔ∏è
Over the past few days, {{< wiki-link "Luigigamin212" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Documentor" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "The 64th Gamer" >}} have been submitting transcriptions of their favorite showtapes. You can see these from the showtape page, but you can also check out {{< wiki-link "Transcriptions" >}} to see what we have currently available! 

The conversion to Markdown has made this even easier to achieve; editors no longer need to memorize confusing tags and formatting.

We have a lot to get through, but with your help we can achieve this! For more information, feel free to join our Discord server.

## Locations, locations, locations... üìç
One of the reasons we moved to Hugo is that we wanted location information to be uniform, clear, and concise. Locations make up over half of our existing pages.

In our Discord server, our most active editors are wrangling existing data from the existing wiki pages to consolidate random fluff and unmoderated nonsense into concise details.

Our goal is to have location pages generated using parameters and links to video pages, stage shows, and animatronics, removing a lot of the "filler" content that people have added that is either not factual or blatantly copied from page to page. Here are some of the ideas we've floated around:

* Using Hugo templates to automatically provide links to stages and animatronics, eliminating stage and animatronic tables from Miraheze that vary in format, and have broken links or inconsistent terminology, leading to a poor/confusing browsing experience.
* Eliminating video tables/links from location pages, ensuring that all videos are instead provided through the "Videos" section of the page, making it easier to see all videos in one spot.
* Fill in some gaps in our data using parameters -- especially {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} show conversion dates, stage changes, latitude/longitude for the {{< wiki-link "Locations" "Locations Map" >}}, franchise dates, etc.
