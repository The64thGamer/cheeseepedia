Two days ago a mysterious "Chuck's Arcade" would appear on the Simon Mall's website scheduled to debut at the Mall of Georgia. While it was clear this was a variant of Funspot Arcades, it was unknown if the location would feature different machines or decor. 
<br>
Last night Mark Kupferman would start an impromptu live QNA in the 'Chuck E. Cheese Fandom' Discord server, where among the many questions answered was clearing up the confusion surrounding the arcade. Later this morning he would sum up his answers in a reddit comment:

<ul>"Hi everyone. Here are a few answers to questions I've gotten about Chuck's Arcade.
<br><br>
What is Chuck’s Arcade?
<br>
It’s a new concept we’re using for mall-based arcades. These are just arcades—no pizza, no live entertainment, no nostalgic artwork, and no animatronics.
<br><br>
Why isn’t it called Chuck E. Cheese?
<br>
We’re keeping the Chuck E. Cheese name for our family-focused venues designed for younger kids. Chuck’s Arcade is aimed at older kids, teens, and adults. It’s a fresh take while still giving a nod to Chuck.
<br><br>
Is it retro or modern?
<br>
The name, logo, and some of the decor have a retro/Chuck vibe, but the games themselves are cutting-edge and totally modern—so think new-school fun, not a nostalgia fest.
<br><br>
Why is it called Chuck's Arcade?
<br>
We felt that our original name, "Funspot Arcade," didn’t tie back to who we are. Chuck E. Cheese is actually the largest operator of arcades in the world (we have almost 50,000 games!), and Chuck’s Arcade is our way of bringing that expertise to new locations. The name connects it to us without confusing people into thinking it’s a full-sized Chuck E. Cheese.
<br><br>
Why did you use a look reminiscent of PTT branding?
<br>
We appreciate our history and loved the chance to create something that ties back to it. The look is meant to harken back to our past while still embracing the modern gaming experience that today’s gamers are looking for. It’s a little nod to where we came from, while staying focused on where we’re headed.
<br><br>
Is Chuck's Arcade exclusive to Simon Malls?
<br>
It is not. But Simon Malls is a great partner, and we look forward to opening the first Chuck's Arcade at the Mall of Georgia in Buford."
</ul>
Outside of clearing up the general confusion and hopes of fans, the main things to take away is that Funspot is simply getting a brand overhaul, which includes heavier CEC branding and in-store theming. This will be how the arcades open in the future, though it has not been said if previous arcades will be remodeled to fit this new look. This push may also bring the arcades to be properly advertised by CEC through its various platforms, though this remains to be seen.
