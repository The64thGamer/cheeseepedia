On March 21, 2025, all Cyberamic {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}, which include {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)" >}} will now be using 3-Stage signals.
<br><br>
This began with {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, which actually began testing the signals in September of 2024. Each of the stores have now recieved a new EPROM chip to convert 3-Stage signals to Cyberamic signals, which are not in the exact same configuration as the {{< wiki-link "CEC-Stage Rosetta" >}} had them. Currently noted are that eyelids, head ups, and Munch/Pasqually arms have inverted movements- meaning eyes are closed when they're supposed to be open. This is due to how movements are designed differently between stages. Northridge's tests did not include this bug except for the head-ups being inverted. The {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} now just has a single playlist for both types of legacy stores, which also forces the Cyberamic stages to use the 3-Stage diagnostics, which can be unhelpful with the miriad of unused or reformatted movements.
<br><br>
Last week all legacy stores were told to disable their random movements in the settings, reasoned to 'prevent maintenance'. This EPROM chip now disables that directly from startup, though it can still be manually toggled on. Another issue is that the settings also accidentally turned on the red and blue floods by default on startup, which keep them on until disabled. 3-Stage stores also recieved a similar EPROM chip on March 11th that auto-disabled random movements.
<br><br>
On top of all this, all stores will now have their ads in-between showtape segments set to region-specific ads- something planned since the very rollout of Navori. This began rollout sometime in early March. It is currently unknown how many regions there are, or what stores inhabit which region. It was also rumored during the 2022 roll-out that local area ads would play, though it is unknown if this has taken effect.
