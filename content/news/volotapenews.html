Since early 2025 it has been known around the fandom that Creative Engineering has been in the works of creating a brand new showtape for the Volo Auto Museum ({{< wiki-link "Volo, IL (27582 Volo Village Rd)" >}}). On April 21st, 2025 this would be announced more widely to the public with a first part release of the ongoing {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering Premium Video Service" >}} behind the scenes series on the making of the tape.
<br><br>
Multiple things are now known about the tape through this: 
<ol>
    <li>The tape is fully brand new and professionally produced, no reuse of older material. Instrumentals are also performed and not ripped from other artists' covers.</li>
    <li>Shooter Jennings will be replacing Fatz's voice, rather than how Aaron has in the past.</li>
    <li>Ted Camp is playing bass, Zach is playing guitar, and Brian is playing guitar and keyboards.</li>
    <li>Aaron wants this to be the start of the Rock-afire coming back, with more to come.</li>
    <li>Showtape is set to release in the Summer.</li>
</ol>
Premium members already have access to more of the parts however, as these were recorded back in February. This alongside correspondance with various employees has given additional information about the tape:
<ol>
    <li>The show is completely themed around cars, matching Volo being an auto museum. The tracklist is:
        <ul>
            <li>Fun, Fun, Fun (Beach Boys)</li>
            <li>I Get Around (Beach Boys)</li>
            <li>The Little Old Lady (Jan & Dean)</li>
            <li>Mustang Sally (Wilson Pickett)</li>
            <li>Little Red Corvette (Prince)</li>
            <li>Pink Cadillac (Bruce Springsteen)</li>
            <li>Cars (Gary Numan)</li>
            <li>409 (Beach Boys)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The tape's length will be 12 minutes total. The songs will be separate segments and not part of a medley.</li>
    <li>Rolfe will sing one of the songs.</li>
    <li>Despite recording starting in February, the tape's audio is still not complete. Programming however has started early with the original songs to go off of, having gone through 20 iterations so far as its upcoming programmer, Rock-afire Zone, is being trained by Aaron. Programming is currently being done in {{< wiki-link "RetroMation" >}}, but hopes are for {{< wiki-link "The Rock-afire Simulator" >}} to have programming functionality ready by audio completion to record there, as it will be formattable to the system Volo uses. If this doesn't go to plan a converter will be used on the RetroMation '.rshw' file.</li>
</ol>
