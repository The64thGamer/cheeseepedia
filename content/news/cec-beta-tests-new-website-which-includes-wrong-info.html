Today it was found a new CEC website is in testing to overhaul the look of the main site. It is unclear how long this new site has been up (the earliest Archive.org snapshot is from February 12th), or how viewers are supposed to organically find it.
<br>
This site tries to personalize its contents based on your set location, which mostly means auto filling specific text with the store name. This sets the first problem with the site, as when viewing the "What's New" page with any store, it will claim the location has received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} or the {{< wiki-link "Trampoline Zone" >}} even when it has not.
<br>
But what's egregious about the new site is its new "Our History" section, which tries to set a world record for misinformation. (It was later found that this comes from the current site's "About Us" page in a small blurb, which has been blown up to be the whole section now) The first two sections going over the first location are fine, but it quickly derails:
<ul>
<li>
"1980 - First live appearance - The iconic and beloved face of Chuck E. Cheese makes his first live appearance in stores."
<ul>
<li>
The first Chuck E. mascot walkaround appeared at the first location during pre-opening either during May 3rd-5th, 1977, or in the first documented photo on May 16th. Every store since has had a walkaround. The photo used is also from 1984, not 1980 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
"1986 - First international location opens - Chuck E. Cheese becomes a global sensation by expanding to the first international location in Guatemala City."
<ul>
<li>
The first international location opened in March 1981 in Australia as {{< wiki-link "Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse" >}}.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
"1994 - A fresh new look - Chuck E. Cheese receives a fresh new look appealing to families of all ages."
<ul>
<li>
The exterior remodel in the photo started in 2004.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
"2011 - Last ball pit removed - Ball pits are no longer a part of the Chuck E. Cheese experience and instead new games and attractions are added."
<ul>
<li>
Some official international stores still have ball pits.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
"2016 - Play pass is introduced - Play Pass & Play Bands take the place of traditional tokens. The tap-to-play game card system provides an easier, more convenient, and cleaner way to play."
<ul>
<li>
Play pass started in 2014.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
"2019 - New fun center renovations - A fresh, vibrant, and contemporary look that is appealing to kids and kids at heart with new games, attractions and more!"
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Everything past this is fine, if you don't count the bootleg Pizza Time Theatre logo on the page, or Jasper's miscolored banjo. Thankfully this site hasn't been merged to the main one yet, and hopefully these glaring issues can be fixed!
