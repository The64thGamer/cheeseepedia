On January 16th Bull Airs would tease a Billy Bob SneakerHeadz production sample. This would be used to pitch to Creative Engineering a potential ShowBiz/Rockafire Bull Airs line consisting of at least the known SneakerHeadz and a custom Nike shoe.
On January 20th, the post would be updated, noting that they were unable to secure the license from Creative Engineering, though it is not stated the reason why. Later on images of the sneaker would leak.
