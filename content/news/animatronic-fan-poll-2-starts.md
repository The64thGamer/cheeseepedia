Six months later and we now enter the second Animatronic Fan Poll! This is to give a census on the general demographics and opinions of the fandom, and as they change over time- since this will hopefully be done every half year.
Keep your results devoid of any identifying information, as the poll results are publically shared so the community can analyze and study the results. Most questions are multi-choice, but there are chosen answers you can voice your opinions directly in. If you have none you can skip most, or they'll have a 'neutral/not me' option.
