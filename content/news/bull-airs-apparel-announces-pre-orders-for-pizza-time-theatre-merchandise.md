Bulls Airs Apparel has opened pre-orders for a Pizza Time Theatre branded Nike AJ1, a collection of "SneakerHeadz" which snap onto the shoe, a varsity jacket, and a t-shirt as part of one launch. Orders open on December 20th. The AJ1 will be a 50 pair run, while the rest of the products seem to not be limited.
The teaser for the upcoming products would happen on December 2nd, with the full pre-launch happening on December 16th. On the 17th an additional t-shirt would quietly be added to the lineup.
