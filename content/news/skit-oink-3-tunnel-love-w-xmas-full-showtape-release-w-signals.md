The full showtape, uncut, of {{< wiki-link "Skit-Oink 3 Tunnel/Love W/XMAS">}} with signals is [now available](https://archive.org/details/ptt_showtape_reels_w_signals). The [uncut audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQe5Yq_8BJA) is also available on YouTube. Previously it was only ever chopped up with signals improperly decoded on Program Blue. Thanks to RockafireFan123 for the rip.
