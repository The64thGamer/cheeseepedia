The {{< wiki-link "Lo Barnechea (Cantagallo), Chile" >}} store, which opened in December of 1994 with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}, today put up a sign on their storefront advertising "Show De Animatronics" alongside a render of the band. With Chuck E. Cheese corporate's acknowledgement of animatronic shows being limited to inner-fandom announcements, or brief press talks, this sign becomes an oddity among the company's branding.
The sign, being put up by the store itself, and not any sort of marketing by corporate to brand it as one of the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}, was led to by the announced closing of {{< wiki-link "Santiago (Plaza Oeste), Chile" >}} in November of 2024, which sparked discussions between local fans and employees of both locations to try and restore the animatronic shows. Since then Cantagallo has had its show slowly repaired and restored, now worthy of being advertised outside the store. The restoration is being carried out by Ame, Isi, and an unnamed third person alongside the store's tech, which started as volunteer work but is now having pay offered. <sup>(1)</sup>
