Paramus (275 Route 4 West) opened as a relocation to the {{< wiki-link "Paramus, NJ (221 South Dr)" >}} on December 26th, 2011 with a Studio C Beta, 16M; this was the last Studio C store to open in the state in New Jersey. When the store opened, they had the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. In around the Mid 2010's, this was one of the small handful of locations to test the 'Chuck E Cheese Fun House' from Soft Play; this was removed during the COVID-19 Pandemic (Like with the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}). This was also one of the stores to test the 'Chuck E.'s Express Ordering' Kiosks, this have also since been removed at an unknown point in time. In around 2019, the exterior was repainted alongside the rest of the plaza. On July 10, 2023 the store would begin its {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}.July 25, 2023 the Studio C Beta would be removed. On September 28, 2023 Paramus would celebrate it's grand re-opening with Helen, Munch, Jasper, and Pasqually. Munch and Jasper were barrowed from {{< wiki-link "Princeton, NJ (520 Nassau Park Blvd)" >}}.
