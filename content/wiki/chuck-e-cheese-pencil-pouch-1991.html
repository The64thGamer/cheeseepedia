The <b><i>Chuck E. Cheese Pencil Pouch</b></i> was a prize counter item released in 1991.
<h2> Design </h2>
The item is a hot pink plastic pouch with three storage areas: a top zipper pouch, a front zipped pouch, and a pocket on the front held in with a snap.
The zippers are light blue, and the pocket snap is a deeper blue. The pocket has the Chuck E. Cheese logo written in red on it. A print of Chuck E. is placed next to the pouch, being of him laying down and drawing. He is drawing with red- and yellow-colored pencils and crayons. He is wearing a Pizza Time Theatre derby, a red and yellow striped shirt, red shorts, and red sneakers.
