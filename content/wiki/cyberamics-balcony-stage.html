The Stage debuted at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}<sup>(1)</sup> location in May of 1980, and went extinct in 1993 at the {{< wiki-link "Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (9271 34th Ave)" >}} location. from 1988 to 1989, most Stages would become {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Pre-Production </h3>
In Early 1980, after the opening of {{< wiki-link "Sparks, NV (530 Greenbrae Dr)" >}} & {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)" >}}, Pizza Time Theatre wanted to make a more standardized Portrait Stage. The final outcome would be replacing {{< wiki-link "Kooser PTT Show" >}} with a new stage called 'Showboat'.
<h3> Pizza Time Theatre </h3>
<h4> Early Balcony Stages </h4>
The Showboat stage was placed at Kooser's Showroom in May of 1980. The stage would turn out to be a success & would later be installed at the opening of {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}} in October 1980 which had Madame Oink instead of Foxy Colleen & the Showtape being either Madame Oink II or {{< wiki-link "Around the World with Madam Oink" >}}. Arlington's Blacony was also more like the later Balcony Stages with the characters being lower down & their being a Cheese-Crawl.
Most locations still opened with a Balcony Stage until December 1980. The Balcony stage was installed at all PTT locations afterwards.
<h4> Later Balcony Stages </h4>
The 'Irish Stew' & '{{< wiki-link "Around the World (PTT Theme)" >}}' Showtapes would have special theme for Balcony Stages. The Balcony Stage would have variants for most other Showtapes following. A Balcony Stage would be installed at the Amusement Park, 'Kids World' in the early to mid 80's, The stage wasn't segmented, meaning their were no barriers between the bots, & there was a strange backdrop behind the characters.
