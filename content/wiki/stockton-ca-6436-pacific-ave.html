<h2> History </h2>
Stockton opened on September 6, 2005 with the 2005 remodel, which included {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} decor, Skytubes, and a Studio C Beta, 16M. Despite being open, there isn't that much documentation on the internet. In August 2018, they received the 2.0 remodel, which removed the Studio C Beta for a 2017 Model Dance Floor. The Skytubes were removed as well. As of July 2023, Stockton remains like this.
