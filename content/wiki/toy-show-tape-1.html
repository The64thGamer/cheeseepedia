<b><i>Toy Show Tape 1</b></i> was the showtape used for Billy Bob's Toyland Adventure Show, which featured at the <i>IAAPA</i> in November of 1995.
The showtape was presumably sent alongside the show to the Family Entertainment Center that purchased it from South America.
<h2> IAAPA Debut </h2>
The showtape would debut at the IAAPA 1995 convention along with the Toyland stage itself. To the left of the stage was the New RAE Lite-CS with Karaoke and NRAE Mini Stage. Each show would play a single segment before passing it onto the next stage. The only <a href="https://youtu.be/I-uKRa6aa5M?t=465"> footage of this showtape</a> during the convention comes from <i>Brian Hagan</i>, who uploaded it onto YouTube on December 18, 2021, featuring <i>Segment 13: Hot Fun in the Summertime.</i>
