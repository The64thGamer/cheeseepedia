## Trivia:

- It's Showtime! bumper which was introduced back in 1988, along with the Cyberstar Intro retires in favor for the new animated intro for CEC-TV debuting in {{< wiki-link "CEC Future" >}}.
- Chuck E's Place would be reused in the future starting with the live show Land of 1000 Dances 1991, and most famously Havin' A Party in 1992.
- The intermission music is the same as {{< wiki-link "SPP Best Of 2" >}} (except it excluded a couple songs for that show).
