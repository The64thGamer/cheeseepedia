Edina, MN (7505 France Ave S) originally opened in early 2000 (month unknown) and closed on June 25, 2020. 

## History

The Edina location opened in 1993 as a Circus Pizza, featuring the {{< wiki-link "New Rock-afire Explosion" >}} in its standard 3-stage format. It was acquired by {{< wiki-link "CEC Entertainment" >}} on August 9, 1999, along with all other remaining Circus Pizza stores. The location was subsequently renovated into a Chuck E. Cheese's, holding its grand opening in the first quarter of 2000. This renovation included a new front counter, furniture, carpet, artwork, signage, game package, and the installation of the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} show.

Initially, the store kept the original playground from its predecessor, rebranding it as its {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}. A few years later, it received generic replacement SkyTubes and was updated with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} upgrade package. Around the fourth quarter of 2010, the location underwent the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} and an expansion, which involved demolishing the wall behind the existing Studio C stage and relocating the showroom to the vacant space next-door, which became an addition to the store. The former showroom was then repurposed for additional games, including skill games like Alley Roller Classic, and new booth seating was installed along the interior wall.

By 2014, the Edina location began testing two new concepts. The first was the "Parents' Time-Out," a semi-enclosed area near the main entrance that featured plush booths, tables, chairs, and multiple TVs showing mainstream broadcast channels. This area also offered free Wi-Fi. The {{< wiki-link "Boca Raton, FL (21699-A State Rd)" >}} store was the only other location to receive this feature; it was removed from there in 2019 during its {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}.

That same year, Edina also began testing {{< wiki-link "Chuck E.'s Play Pass" >}}. CEC Entertainment partnered with a company named Embed to provide the technology for this card-based system. SmartTOUCH tap-card readers were installed on all games and rides, replacing physical tokens. However, physical tickets and {{< wiki-link "Ticket Muncher" >}} machines remained in use at the time. In 2016, CEC's contract with Embed ended, and the company signed with India-based Semnox to begin a nationwide rollout of Play Pass.

The Edina location closed permanently on June 25, 2020, following CEC Entertainment's decision to shutter additional stores after its bankruptcy filing.
