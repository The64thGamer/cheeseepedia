This plush was a part of Dennis Foland Inc's first set of original Chuck E. Cheese plushies and was the first Pasqually plush produced by Dennis Foland Inc.
The 1996 set introduced putting wires and cardboard pieces into the plush's legs and feet to give them the ability to pose and to stand upright on flat surfaces.

### Prototypes

A prototype plush can be seen in the 1997-1998 Merch Catalogue.<sup>(1)</sup> Pictures of the plush show that this plush was originally going to have separate pieces for its eyebrows as opposed to the released plush having them printed on its eyes.

## Design

The plush has a round body with two fat cylindrical legs connected to it. The plush has round arms with mitten-like hands. The plush's head has a sunken in chin, a big round nose, two ears that look like a folded circle. It's two eyes are squares that are rounded out at the top with printed black details to represent his eyebrows and pupils. The plush's mustache is nicely shaped but is ruined by the fuzzy material used on the mustache and hair. A red mouth is featured under the mustache. The plush's shoes are nicely detailed with white and black fabric and blue-ribbon shoelaces and his pants are black. He has a red striped shirt under his apron. His apron has been made smaller compared to the previously released 1992 and 1994 plushies to make room for his poseable legs. He has a sewn neckerchief that can be untied and removed. He also has a white chef's hat with the same red striped pattern on its brim as it was on his shirt.
Its tag reads as **'Chuck E. Cheese's** © 1996 ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. Made in China'. The back reads as ALL NEW MATERIAL Contents: Polyester Fiber ОН 17389 РА 5081 MA 1340 ME 3658 Dennis Foland, Inc. San Jose, CA'.

### Differences Between Small Size

This plush and it's {{< wiki-link "Small Pasqually Plush (1996)" >}} are nearly identical. Everything on the larger plush is more proportionate as every design element is larger. For example, the fuzziness on the mustache and hair is toned down and his arms don't look as inflated.
