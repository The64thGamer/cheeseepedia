## History

Buddy Crash along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<sup>(1)</sup> and currently resides at the CEI museum.

## Design

In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a top hat, collar, black bowtie, and striped vest. At Morey's Piers he wore a straw hat, red bandana, and overalls. He plays the drums with the '4 Seasoned Bears' logo on the front.

## Movements

Due to lack of footage or photos of internals, movements can only be inferred. All that is known is that he along with the rest of the bots in the show had very limited movement.
