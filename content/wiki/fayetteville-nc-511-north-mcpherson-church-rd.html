<h2> Trivia </h2><ul><li>Before Franchised CECs were renumbered to four digit numbers in 2010, Fayetteville was <b><i>Store #209</b></i> according to the old chuckecheese.com website from 2009. It was renumbered to <b><i>Store #3212</b></i> when Corporate renumbered Franchised stores with four digit numbers. The store number is now the store number for the {{< wiki-link "Fargo, ND (1202 Nodak Dr)" >}} location after it was bought out by Corporate.</li></ul>
