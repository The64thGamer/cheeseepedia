The ***Rock & Pizza Roll* was a limited time appetizer at Chuck E. Cheese locations from 2018 through 2019.<sup>(1)</sup>
The item is a long strip of pepperonis and cheese wrapped in a 15 inch roll of dough, served with marinara sauce or ranch. The item is meant to look like the neck of a guitar, with its box completing the look.**

## Rereleases

The initial release started on October 1, 2018, with the item being discontinued on December 30th.<sup>(2)</sup> Two months later the item would relaunch and continue presumably into the summer.<sup>(3)</sup> A third launch would happen on October 1, 2019, continuing somewhere into late November.
The third launch would see an updated description on the website:

> The Rock & Pizza Roll is back for an encore! This pizza roll is over-sized (at 15 inches long!), which makes it the perfect appetizer or snack for anyone in the family. Our fresh-made dough is stuffed with cheese and pepperoni, baked fresh and served with the sauce of your choice (marinara or ranch). This fun, one-of-a-kind item is available starting on October 1st, while supplies last.<sup>(4)</sup>

## Guitar Jingle

The side of the box denotes a small interactable feature that teaches kids how to play a simple tune on a guitar, with a representation of a guitar neck on the other side. Presumably kids would try this on the box while eating, and when they get home play it on a real guitar. The box states:

> The number in the dot shows which numbered fret to go to.
> (A fret is the space between two lines on a guitar neck.)
> The line the dot is on shows which string to hold down and pluck.

No pictures currently show which numbers are on the box lines, though the tune is seven notes, with the first three on the D note, and the latter on the C note. Presumably this is the 'Where a Kid Can Be A Kid' liet motif, promoting kids to learn how to play the tune.
