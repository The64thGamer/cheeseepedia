<b><i>Johnstown, PA (850 Scalp Ave)</b></i> was <b>'Showplace Pizza</b>'. It opened in 1989<sup>(1)</sup>, after the ShowBiz Pizza located at <b><i>{{< wiki-link "Johnstown, PA (1523 Scalp Ave)" >}}</b></i> had a fire. This location most likely opened due to a refusal to undergo Concept Unificiation. It hosed a Rock-Afire-Explosion show and the animatronics presumably came from the previous location. It also had most of the same arcade games and rides a regular ShowBiz would have. Showplace Pizza would eventually close in 1994, bringing the end of the RAE and ShowBiz in Johnstown. A Chuck E. Cheese's would eventually open in 2003 on {{< wiki-link "Johnstown,PA (592 Galleria Dr)" >}} and would close in June of 2020.
The RAE Animatronics origins are unknown but most likely come from the previous ShowBiz location, and their current status is unknown.
