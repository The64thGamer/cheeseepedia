## History

In late 2017, toy designer Justin Ishmael began teasing a collaboration with Aaron Fechter to produce a Billy Bob Brockali toy on social media. A prototype sculpt of the figure by Kenth Toy Works would be shown at DesignerCon. The final version was to be manufactured by Mighty Jaxx, a toy company that specializes in collectable figures. Ishmael would continue to post updates on the figure's production throughout the rest of the year and into 2018. On November 13, 2018, well over a year after it was first announced, the Billy Bob Brockali Vinyl Figure became available to order on Ishmael's website.

## Variants

### 11" Figure

During it's initial run, the figure was produced at a size of 11" in height. It's design was based on the original Billy Bob animatronic from the 1980s, and two variants of the figure were produced, regular and deluxe. The regular variant features Billy Bob and his banjo. The deluxe variant features Billy Bob, his banjo, Birthday Bird, and an alternate head sculpt based on Billy Bob's internal mechanisms. The regular variant was priced at $120, with the deluxe variant costing slightly more at $150. 

### 7" Figure

On May 25, 2022, the Billy Bob Brockali Vinyl Figure would have it's second run, reproduced smaller, this time standing at a height of only 7". Other than it's size, the 7" figure was virtually identical to the original 11" figure, however a deluxe variant would not be produced. It would retail for $100.
