<b><i>40 E Center St, Store #2034</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on August 31, 1983, as a <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}, which closed on July 30, 2017, as a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> with a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Orem opened with the Rock-afire Explosion in 1983. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of Orem with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general.
In June 1991, Orem received {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, converting the Rock-afire into Munch’s Make Believe Band, which they would keep until closure in 2017.
Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Orem’s stage would receive plastic masks, and most notably be declining in condition, as seen in the earliest known video of the stage in 2003. In 2007, Chuck E.’s tuxedo was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. He would also predictably receive Cyberamic hands at this time.
By 2008, the condition of the stage was very poor. Many movements are seen with bad flow control adjustments, or just simply not working. In a video from 2012, Orem is seen in better condition than it was in 2008, but still rather poor. Building, Moon, and the Wink are no longer functional, and Pizzacam and Munch Jr. would also be removed around this time.
In 2014, Orem received the whole Cyberamic stage from the {{< wiki-link "Sandy, UT (10535 So State St)" >}} store which had closed the same year. However, Orem was unable to use most of the mechanics and cosmetics due to them being Cyberamic, making them incompatible.
In 2015, the condition of the stage had gotten worse. Pasqually barely moved, and very loud squeaks were occasionally heard, something which is very abnormal. The condition of the stage would remain mostly the same until closure in 2017.

<h2>Post Closure</h2>
In 2017, it was announced the Orem store would be closing after 34 years of operation. The owner was fighting cancer, and there was also mold all over the walls in the storage rooms. On July 30, 2017, Orem closed its doors for the final time. However, for their stage, that wouldn’t be the end.
The owners of the {{< wiki-link "Billings, MT (100 24th St)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Fargo, ND (1202 Nodak Dr)" >}} locations ultimately ended up purchasing Orem’s show. Chuck E., Munch, Jasper, and Pasqually were sent to Billings, and Helen, Building, and Moon were sent to Fargo. Billings still uses the three characters they recieved for parts to this day, whereas Fargo no longer has their 3-Stage, and the Orem characters they had were saved by a collector.
The building would be completely gutted and turned into Downeast Home & Clothing, which still operates to this day.
