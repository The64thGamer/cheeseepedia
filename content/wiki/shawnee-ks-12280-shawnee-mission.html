<h2> History </h2>
Shawnee opened on August 19, 1981 as a ShowBiz Pizza Place with a Rock-afire Explosion. Sadly, information on Shawnee's ShowBiz is scarce, and very, very few photos exist, but we are sure no videos exist. On October 13, 1985, the location closed for unknown reasons, but likely due to underperformance. Many businesses took up the space, but the store that currently holds this address is a DVD store named Vintage Stock.
