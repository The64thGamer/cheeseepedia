The ***Winchester Pizza Time Theatre Show* was a set of animatronics built exclusively for the first Pizza Time Theatre location at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)">}} and used from May 17th, 1977 to sometime between 1980 and 1981 when they were replaced with {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics">}}.
The show consisted of the main characters and moving props placed along the bannisters of the showroom, with the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Warblettes (Animatronic)">}} hung below the ceiling.**

## History

All characters were produced by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest">}}, mainly by its owner Harold Goldbrandsen. Fantasy Forest was previously a mascot costume manufacturer, making the Winchester show their first animatronic products created. Atari's Cyan Engineering (also known as the Grass Valley Team) would handle the creation of the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Control System">}}, headed by Larry Emmons and Gary Waters.<sup>(1)</sup>

## Animatronics

The {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese Proof of Concept Prototype (Animatronic)">}} was initially built as a concept piece for the location, but was never intended to be used inside the building.
The main animatronics and their locations were:

- {{< wiki-link "Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V1 (Animatronic)">}} (South West Corner)

  Bannisters)
