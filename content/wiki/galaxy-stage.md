## History

## Design

The backdrop features many futuristic buildings as well as a rocket and a moon. In the center was a large TV in a green frame with four holes on each side, and a button underneath that when pressed would switch the footage shown on it from the showtape to that of a camera above the showroom area. By 2013, the button and camera were removed and the TV would be replaced with a smaller one while retaining the original frame. On the right side of the stage was Chuck E.'s platform which had one light strip at the top and four at the bottom, as well as windows and purple supports. Behind Chuck E. were four buildings, each with lights. The left side of the stage featured the ticket blaster with a unique green rocket top and a 'Ticket Blaster' sign. Around the stage was carpet which featured green and purple stars and above was a purple banner with green text saying 'Where A Kid Can Be A Kid'.
