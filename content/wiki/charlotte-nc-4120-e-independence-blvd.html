<b><i>4120 E Independence Blvd</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> in Charlotte, North Carolina that opened on March 30th, 1982, and closed in October 1984.
This is not to be confused with the Chuck E. Cheese's on {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (5612 Albemarle Rd)" >}} (which is 5-7 minutes from this location) that opened in November 1991 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}. It should also not be confused with the ShowBiz Pizza Place on {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}} which opened on October 11th, 1982, with a Rock-afire Explosion, and is still open to this day with a 3-Stage.
<h2> History </h2>
Charlotte opened with either Harmony Howlette or Madame Oink as their guest star. Charlotte would later get Helen Henny, who stayed until Charlotte permanently closed. This was one of two Pizza Time Theatres in the Carolinas, the other being in {{< wiki-link "Raleigh, NC (4339 Falls of Neuse Rd)" >}}.
After Charlotte closed in October 1984, the store was auctioned off like most PTTs. The building it was located in was reoccupied by an unknown tenant; the building was then demolished for a highway expansion sometime in 2002. As of June 2023, the highway expansion still sits on the site of the plot of land where the PTT once sat.
