**January 2012** is a compilation show featuring eight reused songs from 1999 - 2011 alongside newly recorded dialogue.
This was created to play from January 1, 2012 - March 31, 2012, though was valid as a backup show until the end of 2012.<sup>(1)</sup> This was the final showtape to have Robert Gotcher involved in any capacity, though much of his work was altered or removed in the final release.

## Unused Version

An unused version of this show exists with every song after The Weekend being completely different, though most of the dialogue between songs is the same with a few differences. The show also featured Robert Gotcher in the role of Jasper, though the reused songs would still use Jeremy Blaido's voice. The Showtime intro at the beginning of each segment would also have Robert's voice, unlike the final version which had Matt Daniel dub over him. The final segment also contained two brand new songs, 'That's How It Would Go' and 'You Are My Best Friend'.
Prior to being rerecorded, the segments (excluding intermissions) were:

1.  **Segment 1**
    1.  'First Impression'
    2.  'Imagine Nation'
2.  **Segment 2**
    1.  'The Weekend'
    2.  'I'm Gonna Dream'
3.  **Segment 3**
    1.  'Toppings'
    2.  'Cleaning Up My Room'
4.  **Segment 4**
    1.  'That's How It Would Go'
    2.  'You Are My Best Friend'

After Robert Gotcher was fired as Director of Entertainment, the songs he wrote and his voice were removed from the show. Jeremy was brought back to record over his lines, Matt Daniel recorded a new version of the showtime intro, and most of the songs were replaced. 'First Impression', 'Imagine Nation', and 'The Weekend' were also altered, with the instrumentals being rerecorded for the former and new vocals for Jasper being recorded for the later. It is unknown if there were any intermission differences.
