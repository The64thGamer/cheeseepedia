## Trivia:

- This is the final showtape to have puppet footage exclusively for Studio C, as all showtapes afterwards use puppets for all stages. Segments 1 & 2 have new puppet footage with the Studio C curtains as a backdrop, while Segments 3 & 4 reuse puppet footage from {{< wiki-link "Fall Show 2013" >}}. 
- Bobby Bear is re-edited with additional effects and shortened scenes. The theme song is moved to the beginning of the sketch, and the July 1991 Wink sound effect is added to the end.
- 'Back in Time' is reused from {{< wiki-link "September 2007 Show" >}}, 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' and 'The Final Countdown' are reused from {{< wiki-link "Spring 2012 Show" >}}, 'Shake Your Groove Thing', 'My Karate Kid', and 'Larry Go To The Store' are reused from {{< wiki-link "Fall 2012 Show" >}}, Hard Hat Hank - 'Nu-cu-lar', Chuck E. Cheese Cast Member Remix, Show Break - 'Motorcyle', Bobby Bear - 'Three Mice', and Show Break - 'Girls Skipping' are reused from {{< wiki-link "Spring 2013 Show" >}}, Marvin The Technology Guru - 'Beards', 'It’s Tricky', 'Good Time', Show Break - 'New Shoes', and Show Break - 'Cloudy Timelapse' are reused from {{< wiki-link "Fall Show 2013" >}}.
- Segment 1 reuses dialogue from {{< wiki-link "Fall 2012 Show" >}}, with Chuck E.’s lines rerecorded and an extra line by Jasper. Segment 2 reuses most of its dialogue from {{< wiki-link "Spring 2012 Show" >}}, with Chuck E.’s lines rerecorded by Jaret Reddick. Pasqually’s joke in Segment 2 is reused from {{< wiki-link "Fall Show 2013" >}}. Segment 3 and 4 reuse their dialogue from {{< wiki-link "Fall Show 2013" >}}, with Segment 3 having new lines to lead into 'Back in Time'. 
- 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' and 'Back in Time' feature rerecorded vocals by Jaret Reddick. 'The Final Countdown' was rerecorded to have Pasqually sing for the entire song, and the dialogue from the original show was removed. These three songs also saw changes to their video footage; 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' was re-edited to remove most of Chuck E.’s appearances, 'Back in Time' had a brand new video, and reused footage from {{< wiki-link "Fall Show 2013" >}} was added to 'The Final Countdown'.
- The hidden timecode video for Studio C is a clip from the end of the 1988 Walkaround Training. 
- The existing stage versions of ‘Happy & You Know It’, ‘Old MacDonald’, and ‘BINGO’ were reprogrammed for this show.
