## Production

### File Dates

(CEC Stage) Finalized DVD: 03/14/21 8:35pm - 8:38pm

## Correct Version (V2)

The initial DVD release for Show 2 2021 was missing the programming for 'Stay Positive', 'Crochet All Day', ' Chuck E.'s Middle Name', and 'Spring Break Break Dance'. This was due to a [major winter storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm). A DVD with the programming added was shipped out for Existing stages, a new floppy was shipped for Studio C, and a new microSD for Weigl, labeled 'FINAL Version', was sent out two weeks later during the week of March 15, 2021.
