The ***Pizza Time Theatre Basic Ordering Agreement* is a partially lost group of early {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} documents detailing the early concepts of the company and its first two locations: {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}, likely dating between 1976-1977.
The documents are currently in possession by Gene Landrum, and only a few photos of their contents have surfaced.<sup>(1)</sup>**

### Ordering

Notably, all the pages seem to be put together by date. Page 3, while not denoting a specific date, does not give the cat character a name, which was later named sometime by the {{< wiki-link "The Big Cheese Birthday Show Dialogue Recording Session (October 7, 1976)" >}} in October. The only outlier is Page 35, which details the costs of assembling animation hardware for the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} location- though it being of financials may have it as part of a separate financial section of the documents.
