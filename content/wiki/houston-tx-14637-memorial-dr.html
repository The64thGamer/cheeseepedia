<h2> History </h2>
<h3> ShowBiz Pizza Place </h3>
This location originally opened as a ShowBiz Pizza Place on August 26th, 1981. Like every ShowBiz Pizza location, this location featured the Rock-afire Explosion.
<h3> Chuck E. Cheese's </h3>
Memorial Drive went through {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} in 1991. Not that much information is known about this store, but had received several changes/remodels on its stage and store over the years.
Around the late 90's, this location had received the Phase 3 remodel. They closed in October 2012 following the opening of the {{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (12523 Westheimer Rd)" >}} store. After their closure in 2012, they were abandoned for a little bit with the inside being completely gutted until being taken over by a furniture store and other multiple businesses around 2013. In 2020, the furniture store closed to be replaced by a bank called Frost. As of December 2022, the bank 'Frost' still exists with one business closing and becoming a Stretch Lab in 2020.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. Between 1998-2006, the Pasqually animatronic would have its hands replaced with cyberamic hands. The stage would stay that way until their closure in October 2012. This was the only location that had Cyberamic Pasqually's hands.
