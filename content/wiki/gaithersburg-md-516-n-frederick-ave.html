<b><i>516 N Frederick Ave, Store #401</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in March 1983 (day unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed in June 2020 (day unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 16m.
<h2>Stages </h2>
Gaithersburg had a Balcony Stage at first. However, not much documentation exists on the stage. It is currently unknown if they had {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}, but it is likely they did. They later got a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}} in 1991/1992. It didn't last long as well, because they received a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} in the Mid '90s. They later received a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 16m during the 2005 remodel. It lasted up until the 2020 closure.

<h2>History</h2>
Gaithersburg opened in March 1983 (date unknown) as a franchised owned Pizza Time Theatre with a Balcony Stage. However, information on Gaithersburg as a PTT is scarce. Around 1989/1990, they received the 1988 remodel, getting rid of all PTT elements and replacing them with 1988 remodel elements like checkers, and likely replaced the Balcony Stage with Chuck E.'s House Facade, but this is not confirmed. In the early 90's, Gaithersburg received one of three Road Stages in Maryland which was replaced by a 2-Stage in the mid 90's. Around 1994 or 1995, they received {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}, renovating the entire store, and removing the Road Stage for a 2-Stage. They later received {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} around 1997/1998. They received {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} in the early 2000's.
In late 2005, Gaithersburg would remodel once again to the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, removing the 2-Stage and breaking down the wall where the show once stood for a 16m Studio C Beta and relocating the showroom to the back of the store where the gameroom was, tearing down the showroom walls and balcony seating, replacing the decor, changing the exterior again, diminished the SkyTubes and added purple walls. Gaithersburg remained like this until June 2020 (day unknown), when the store permanently closed due to low sales caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The building the CEC occupied would remain vacant for a year or two until it became a Five Below. As of July 2023, Five Below is still on the space.
