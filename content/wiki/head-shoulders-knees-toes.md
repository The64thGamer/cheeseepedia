***'Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes'*** was a road show which was first released in July 2008 on the {{< wiki-link "Revised Road Show 2008" >}} CD. It would then continue to be rereleased on further road show CDs, allowing it to be playable through the end of 2013.

## Choreography Video
A choreography video was released alongside the live show in 2008, featuring Chuck E. and two cast members and using a demo version of the song. This video could be played like a standard live show and was the only way to play this live in the showroom, though it was only intended for use after store hours.
