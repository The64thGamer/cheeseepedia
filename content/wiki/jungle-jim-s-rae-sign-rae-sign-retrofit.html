The RAE Sign was originally located in the 'Hot Sauce & Fiery Foods' section of the store where the fire truck is currently located. In its original location the the sign was a red to yellow gradient with the red on the outer edge with yellow towards the middle. The sign read 'Hot!' 10 times around the boarder and in the middle. The original lighting system was still used and would loop from the Outer Light through the Inner light. The sign was eventually removed and relocated in 2004 after the sign was replaced with the fire truck.
The sign was then relocated in 2004 to where it is currently located with it receiving a complete make over to remove all references to it being originally in the hot sauce section. the front of the sign was replaced with a solid red reading the word 'GROCERIES' the back of the sign had a sign added on being white reading 'Thru Beer & Wine'. the pole that supported the sign was cut and lighting loop was removed. As of June 2022 it is still being used for display.
