## Production

### Master Tape

The Master SVHS Tape for King '90 contains the tracks for both King '90 I and II and has the date of 10/03/90. As the show has no video, the footage of the tape is simply text listing the tape name, skit number, and file name for the programming data (ex. 1CCRYDR.KNG). Inside the case for the master at CEC's entertainment department was the following:

"This tape was used to make the King '90 #1 & #2 audio tape. There is a short tone at head of tape. The 1st 8 skits were used to make #1 and the last 7 were used to make #2. Since it takes 26 skits to make a CABARET tape, #1 has 3 rotations of 8 plus 4 & 5 to make 26. #2 has 3 rotations of 7 and 1 through 5 to make 26."
