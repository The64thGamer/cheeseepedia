(Geez the worst time to remove uploading images :)
The more Iconic style of the PTT Branding, tell anyone and they will most likely show you this one. This reused the original 1977 Chuck E. Head but slightly tweaked up, and a body with his 2 arms sticking out, and his signature vest.

## History

This signage was first used in 1981 in a unknown PTT, it's the first signage to use the 'Custom' curvy font, and the most used in newspapers (followed by the 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' - Letters / Logo (SPT Exterior Signage)|Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza logo) its also the first to use the most iconic CEC Logo Frame which is still used to this day, as both a road sign and a logo sign, used in Northridge, CA, Manchester NH, and San Jose, CA respectively, and the last sign to be used from the 80's on a CEC, that location being {{< wiki-link "Redding, CA (2167 Hilltop Dr)" >}}.

## Variants

They're so many variants of the logo, we have the Vertical variant, most usually used in road signs, the logo without Chuck just the letters, the logo but with a different Chuck that looks like {{< wiki-link "Harrisburg, PA (3883 Union Deposit Rd)" >}} logo, the late 80's logo without it saying Pizza Time Theatre, and the horizontal variant, used in the {{< wiki-link "Louisville, KY (5000 Shelbyville Rd)" >}} location
