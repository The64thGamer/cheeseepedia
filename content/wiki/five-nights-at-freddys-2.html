                Josh Hutcherson would do an interview with Esquire. Discussing the 2nd movie, he stated "It's much bigger; the stakes are higher, there's more animatronics being brought in, different animatronics being brought in, and the world just opens up in a big way. We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded. That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there. It's so over-the-top and wacky, in a way, that to find the emotional truth of the characters was gonna be what was gonna work. I think the fans are gonna flip for it. It's gonna be a lot of fun with the source. It's gonna be scarier, too, actually." On the topic of Josh returning for more FNaF films, he said “You never know, I mean, I love working in this world. Emma Tammi, our director, is phenomenal, and with my character, Mike, I think the possibilities are endless. This could have a very potentially long run and it could be a lot of fun, but at this point we're focusing on the second movie. We'll see what comes after that.” When discussing portraying beloved characters like his role as Peeta in The Hunger Games, he replied "Because it was such a beloved book that was really meaningful in what these characters represented, [The Hunger Games] was a bit of a higher-pressure adaptation than Freddy's, because Freddy's isn't so much about his beloved character. So there's less risk in that regard, but it's still always a high bar when you take on any project that has a built-in fan base, because you want the fans to love it and feel like it captures what they love about the original source material."<sup>(12)</sup>

                Matthew Lillard would do an interview with Forbes. On the topic on what he could say about the film, Lillard noted "Not much, to be honest, I will say that I think the filmmakers have done a great job of learning from the first movie of what fans want, and I think they're giving a lot more of that. It's going to be more exciting, and I think it's going to have more action. It's going to have a lot of character development stuff. It's hard to kiss around it. I think the story ends, and this movie ends in a really exciting way. The business reality is that here's a huge hit movie, you have a feeling they're probably going to make more of them, and I think they do a good job in the second film, making sure that people will want more." Lillard also noted the sequel was confirmed to be PG-13.<sup>(13)</sup>

    <li>On October 4th, another interview with Matthew Lillard would be held with Collider. About filming dates, he would say "So this morning, I got a text with my dates. So, my dates are the beginning of November and another series of dates. So, we’re going to work. I'm really thrilled. I think the script’s fantastic." On the topic of the 2nd film, he would note that "he and the rest of the team were ready to get on with the next chapter in what is quickly blossoming into a fan-favorite horror franchise". He would discuss “[Emma Tammi’s] great. She’s really lovely. And Josh is great. The whole cast is great, and I think we're all excited to come back. I think we learned a lot in the first film. I think the second film is going to sort of benefit from those things. We're all excited about where the movie is at right now.” On the topic of the previous film releasing during an actor's strike compared to this release he would say "The last time the movie came out, none of us could promote it because we were all in a strike, and it was on Peacock but nobody really knew what was there. I knew because I'm in amongst the kids every weekend. I'll have kids in Five Nights gear, a spring trap, or a Freddy costume. Like I said, it's rounding third base and coming home in a career to have something as iconic and beloved by such a new generation. It is a special thing that everybody is very excited about. I hear about it all the time and I am excited, as well."<sup>(14)</sup></li>
    <li>On October 17th, an interview with Matthew Lillard from ComicBook would confirm he was beginning filming "in 10 days". This would conflict with his prior statement of him filming in November, alongside that being a day before official filming was set to commence.</li>
