***SPP Friends / Moms / TV Themes* is one of the last few showtapes released for *ShowBiz Pizza Place's* hosting the *Rock-afire Explosion*, releasing on June 11, 1990.
For some stores, this was the last tape used before *Concept Unification* would start at their location. Each tape
sent after {{< wiki-link "SPP Christmas '89 Wave Bday" >}} would become
increasingly more rare as stores would convert to *3-Stages.*
It was also the final showtape to feature any new *Rock-afire Explosion* material from CEI as Friends, and Rock
& Roll Tribute were the last segments they've released.
In September 1990 they released {{< wiki-link "SPP Best of 1 Kids/Friends" >}}out of 5 in a series of compilation tapes, *ShowBiz Pizza Place* locations would play them
until that store received *Concept Unification*.**
