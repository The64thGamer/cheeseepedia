<h2> History </h2>
Waldorf opened on June 18, 2012 as a relocation of the old store, which had brought the Studio C Alpha to the new store. It had a very unique entrance area, which had a set of emergency exit doors right by the main entrance doors. It also opened with the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included early 2010s decor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Alpha stage. In the mid-late 2010s, however, the Skytubes were removed and were replaced with more kid games and rides. As of September 2023, the store remains open to this day.
