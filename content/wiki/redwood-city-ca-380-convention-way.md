***Redwood City, CA (380 Convention Way)*** (also known as ***San Mateo***) was a two-story {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} location that opened in August of 1981, and closed in early 1986{{< cite 2 >}}{{< cite 6 >}} 

## History

RSKT, Inc., franchisee of the {{< wiki-link "Sunnyvale, CA (1247 W El Camino Real)" >}} and Milpitas, CA (346 S Abel St) locations would open Redwood City as their third franchise in August of 1981.{{< cite 3 >}} In Summer of 1982, the location's CEC Mascot would present with Donna Clark, Miss Redwood City of 1982, a proclamation of 'Chuck E. Cheese Day' for the city of Redwood on an uncited day.{{< cite 4 >}}

On May 7, 1983, the location would sponsor the *12th Annual Angel Island Run* to help raise money for underprivileged children. Over 1,500 participants would run the 4.8-mile race along an island in San Francisco Bay. Multiple corporate members would attend the event:

- Marketing: Pat Saign, Don Schulte
- Finance: Steve Merchant
- Wardrobe: Tine Ahmann
- Graphics: Karen Mitchell

Don Schulte would run the race in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume, clocking in at 44 minutes, ahead of most other runners. Other costume characters would greet people on the island, whether in the race or not. A 30-foot inflatable Chuck E. Cheese was set up on a hill in the island, visible to passing sailboats.{{< cite 5 >}}

### Closing

The location would hold a closing auction on February 8, 1986, at 10AM.{{< cite 1 >}} The auction would sell 'Video Games, Kiddie Rides, Amusements, Cyberamics System, Like-New Restaurant Equipment'. An unknown buyer would confirm to have bought Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny, Pasqually, Munch, heads of Madam Oink, Harmony Howlette, and Dolli Dimples, a Cyberamics Control Center, a box of controller cards, signage, the Clapper Board, and the Band Board. These would later go up for auction again in the 2010's. *80's Girl / Kobun37* would get the Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic, and the rest sent with Damon E. Breland.{{< cite 2 >}}
