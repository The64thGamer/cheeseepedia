The ***PTT Early Cyberamic Replacements*** was an initiative in 1983 that that replaced early Cyberamics across stores with later variants. 

## Description

It is unclear if just the main Pizza Time Players would be redone, or if Warblettes, prop characters, and Carbaret/Lounge acts would be replaced, as these characters were removed in later remodels before being inspected. Only a few stores have been confirmed to have this swap take place, but it is believed most early stores recieved it.
