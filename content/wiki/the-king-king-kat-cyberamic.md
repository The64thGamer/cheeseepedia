***The King / King Kat (Cyberamic)*** was a 9-foot-tall animatronic character inspired by Elvis Presley, debuting at Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.

## Appearance & Movements

He wore a white jumpsuit with silver lining and held a red guitar, capturing Elvis's iconic look. His left foot tapped to the beat, while his mouth moved in sync with the lyrics. He also swiveled his hips, tilted his head, and performed signature gestures as he sang classic Presley songs.

## Songs

The King could dedicate songs to Pizza Time Theatre members and encourage guests to visit the main dining area, explore the Fantasy Forest, or enjoy some pizza. Even after Pizza Time Theatre's closure, some locations kept him performing Chuck E. Cheese songs until 1995.
The King made cameo appearances in the 2017 music video Every Boy Every Girl and the 2018 animated short Halloween at the Pizza Time Theatre, alongside Dolli Dimples and Madame Oink.

## King Kat

The King Kat version of The King was designed as a Michael Jackson-themed animatronic, performing Jackson's songs using original recordings. He wore sunglasses, a curly Afro, a red-sequined jacket, a sequined glove, and held a microphone. His styrofoam sunglasses completely obscured his eyes. Introduced during Pizza Time Theatre's financial struggles, King Kat was intended to boost business. However, after Pizza Time Theatre went bankrupt and merged with ShowBiz Pizza Place, only a few King Kat animatronics were produced before being discontinued.
A King Kat vest was discovered at Smitty's, later sold to the Volo Auto Museum, where both King Kat and The King are now on display.
