<b><i>6700 Abercorn St, Store #605</b></i> was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on October 5, 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.
This converted to a Chuck E. Cheese around 1991, and then received 2.0 in 2021.
<h2>History</h2>
Savannah opened on October 5th, 1982 as the 8th ShowBiz Pizza store in Georgia with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently, a corporate owned store. They would later end up receiving the 1988 Remodel removing the old ShowBiz decor, and adding newer decor. In 1991, Savannah received Concept Unification which removed the Rock-Afire for the 3-Stage and removed all ShowBiz decor, added new decor, and a change to the exterior. Savannah underwent another remodel in the Late 90's which involved the removal of the Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, some checkers around the store, and another exterior change. In 2006-2007, Savannah received the CEC 2005 Remodel|2005 Remodel which removed all 1990's store art, Balcony Seating, Showroom Walls, another change to the exterior and expanded the store, and adding purple walls. In December 2021, Savannah received the 2.0 remodel which removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor. As of January 2023, Savannah still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations had. In around 1991, Savannah would undergo Concept Unification, turning the RAE into Munch's Make Believe Band. In late 2021, Savannah received 2.0 and the 3-Stage was removed for the Dance Floor.
