<b><i>September 2004 Show</b></i> is the show that released September 2004 and played until the end of November 2004.
This show was the first released with Robert Gotcher as Director of Entertainment. The show is also known to have a lost song on it, which was removed sometime before its final release.
<h2> Going On a Diet </h2>
A lost song called 'Going On a Diet' was removed from the showtape before its release. The song was a parody of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Blinded_Me_with_Science"> 'She Blinded Me With Science'</a> and was sung by Munch with Pasqually also having a small part. The video footage featured the band working out at a gym. The footage was later used with stock music in the April 2005 Show and a small clip of the song itself can be heard in a VJ spot in Best of CEC TV 2008. The song was intended for Segment 2 and was replaced by 'Go To Chuck E. Cheese' reused from the April 2002 show. It was cut due to corporate executives thinking it was insensitive.<sup>(1)</sup>
