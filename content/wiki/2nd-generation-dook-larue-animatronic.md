 ***Along side 2nd Generation Mitzi, 2nd Generation Dook Larue* was an updated version of {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}} made in 1983 by  CEI \*Creative Engineering\* with only 4 ever made. Unlike 1st gen Dook with limited movements, the 2nd gen Dook hade many more, being able to use a full drum set with his wrist, Sadly because CEI's #1 competitor CEC \*chuck e cheese\* Showbiz went under a rebranding known as Concept unification, which retired the Showbiz name ending The Rock-afire Explosion. But Arron Fetcher never stopped working on the 2nd Gen Dook and Mitzi.**
