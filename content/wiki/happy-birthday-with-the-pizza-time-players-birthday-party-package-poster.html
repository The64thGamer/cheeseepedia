The <b><i>Happy Birthday With The Pizza Time Players Birthday Party Package</b></i> poster was used at Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre locations for the purpose of advertising the Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Package and the Jasper T. Jowl's Birthday Package.
<h2> History </h2>
This poster was possibly produced from the span of late 1978 to 1981, as it showcases an earlier Chuck E. Cheese walkaround character. The sign was used to advertise the birthday party packages Pizza Time Theatre offered, with the exception of the Gala Dolli Dimples Birthday Party Package.
<h2> Design </h2>
On a yellow piece of paper enclosed in a brown border, the text 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY WITH THE PIZZA TIME PLAYERS BIRTHDAY PARTY PACKAGE' in large text was placed at the top with an early Chuck E. Cheese walkaround placed to the left of the paper, with balloons showcasing the text 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' with several designs of children and a Chuck E. Cheese head on 2 out of the 3 balloons. The bottom of the page reads:
'All birthdays are fun. But a birthday at Pizza Time Theatre is something else. Make reservations two weeks in advance by telephoning our birthday host or hostess for further details and prices.'
In the middle, the text describing each birthday package reads:
<h3> Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Package </h3>
