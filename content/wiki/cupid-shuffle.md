***'Cupid Shuffle'*** was a road show which was first released in January 2010 on the {{< wiki-link "Road Show 2010" >}} CD and featured a cover of the song ['Cupid Shuffle'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid_Shuffle). Sometime in 2010, it would be released on Studio C. Existing Stages would not receive it until July 2012, where it would play until the end of December before being fully replaced by Cupid Shuffle 2012. Throughout its run, it would never be programmed.

## Summary
The only video for this live show on Studio C was the ‘Chuck E. Live’ logo from Chuck E. March 2001. The video for Existing Stages features Michael Hill doing the Cupid Shuffle in front of the 3-Stage at the corporate offices, with Chuck E. joining in later. The {{< wiki-link "Rick Rat Walkaround" >}} also makes a brief appearance in which he shows the wrong way to do the Cupid Shuffle. It ends with a shot of Michael Hill at the end of a hallway wearing a CEC shirt.
