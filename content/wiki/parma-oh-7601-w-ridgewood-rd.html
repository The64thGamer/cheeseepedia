<h2> History </h2>
In 1999, the Discovery Zone located in Parma OH closed as part of their bankruptcy and was one of the 13 locations reopened as a Chuck E. Cheese's, featuring a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}
The store would remain practically untouched, save for Chuck's Late-Night outfit being replaced in 2008, the relocation of the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} from the front gameroom to the back gameroom in 2012, the disabling of the curtains in 2016 and the removal of the {{< wiki-link "Interactive Console" >}} and Blue Screen camera in 2016 and 2014, respectively, until 2016,
At this time, Parmatown Mall, the shopping center the store is located in, was torn down and its plaza refurbished. While Chuck E. Cheese's would remain standing, it would be receiving a new exterior. The new exterior was installed in late 2016 and featured Rockstar Chuck E.
The interior of the store would keep its 1999 appearance until August 2017 when Parma was ordered to undergo the 2015 Remodel, along with {{< wiki-link "North Olmsted, OH (26104 Great Northern Sh)" >}} The store kept its showroom walls and balcony seating, which stores typically removed while remodeling. It also kept other 1999 elements such as: the beverage sign, welcome signing, and dim showroom lighting. The only other change the store would see after this was the complete removal of the Skytubes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Parma began the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} on May 12th 2024. The {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} was destroyed on the first night of the remodel. The balcony seating and showroom walls would be kept during the remodel.
<h2> Fight </h2>
On March 9th, 2015, several patrons began attacking kitchen staff over a game malfunctioning. The police were called, and charges were filed.
