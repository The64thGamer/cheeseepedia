Brain-I-Vac is an animatronic that's described as a combination of computers, calculators and a vacuum cleaner who acts as Chuck E.'s first officer; calculating coordinates and keeping the command module tidy.

## Design

Brain-I-Vac's body is composed of a red vacuum cleaner, typewriter. It's handle has a colender with decorations attached to the end of the lip. It also appears to have makeshift earrings attached to the back of the handle. Brain-I-Vac also has a simple smile, with that, googly eyes and arms that would move freely.
