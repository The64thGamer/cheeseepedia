The <b><i>Colander Head Club Membership Card</b></i> was a special card produced for contributing patrons of the {{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)" >}} during the month of March 1983.
The card could be used to win prizes on Wednesday nights during the event if also wearing a colander to the restaurant.
<h2> Obtainability </h2>
The card was obtainable by fulfilling multiple criteria from March 1st - 31st of 1983.<sup>(1)</sup><ol><li>Attend a ShowBiz Pizza Place wearing a colander on your head, encouraged to be customized and decorated but not required.</li><li>Request the staff to play the {{< wiki-link "3 Birthday Shows - Colander History - Indoctrination Skit" >}} in the Showroom, or wait till Wednesday nights where the show would be played for the groups attending.</li><li>Watch the skit and follow along with its instructions by taking the oath (though following along was not enforced).</li></ol>
A ShowBiz employee would then hand you the card. Patrons could then return each Wednesday night to receive 6 free tokens, a free coke, and a signed picture of one of the Rock-afire Explosion characters. Despite Colander Night returning in September of 1983 for the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" >}}, the membership card would not be handed out- nor used to identify members for prizes.<sup>(2)</sup>
