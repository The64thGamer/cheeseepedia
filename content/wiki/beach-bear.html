<b><i>Beach Bear</b></i> is one of the main characters of the ShowBiz Pizza Place franchise, having made his debut as an animatronic at {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Origins </h3>
Beach Bear was based off of the character of the same name from the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}}. He got his first animatronic in {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}. He would originally have grey fur, blonde hair, and a lei. He would originally have a voice provided by Aaron Fechter.
<h3> ShowBiz Pizza Place </h3>
Beach Bear would originally be portrayed as an unintelligent and dopey character. Over time, Creative Engineering was looking for a permanent Beach Bear voice actor. A programmer by the name of Rick Bailey would sing the {{< wiki-link "Moon (Animatronic)" >}}'s vocals in the Abbey Road Medley in 1983, and Aaron Fechter recommended him as the voice of Beach Bear going forward. Beach Bear would now be a much more intelligent character, as he frequently referenced random facts and used big words. He liked to tease the other band members, and mostly kept to himself. Beach Bear would get white fur, while keeping his blonde hair and lei. Eventually, Aaron Fechter ordered ShowBiz to remove Beach Bears blonde hair, as he thought it would improve the appearance of the character.
<h3> The New Rock-afire Explosion </h3>
After {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, Creative Engineering wanted to find a new way to bring the Rock-afire Explosion back into the public spotlight. They developed the New Rock-afire Explosion. Every character was changed, including Beach Bear. Beach Bear no longer played the guitar, and wore a blue shirt. Beach Bears voice actor returned throughout the 21st century to make new songs. Original parts for Beach Bear would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
