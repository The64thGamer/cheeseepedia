<b><i>3241 Plaza Way</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on June 18, 2012 and is still open today with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, which was the last store to open with one.
This was the relocation of {{< wiki-link "Waldorf, MD (2928 Festival Way)" >}} which opened on March 24, 1992 with the first ever {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} and closed on May 24, 2012 with a Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha, which was brought over to the new store.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Waldorf opened with a Studio C Alpha, which was from the old store. On September 19, 2022, the bot was no longer going to be programmed. In late 2023, the Studio C Alpha would be taken out in favor of a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}.

<h2> History </h2>
Waldorf opened on June 18, 2012 as a relocation of the old store, which had brought the Studio C Alpha to the new store. It had a very unique entrance area, which had a set of emergency exit doors right by the main entrance doors. It also opened with the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included early 2010s decor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Alpha stage. In the mid-late 2010s, however, the Skytubes were removed and were replaced with more kid games and rides. As of September 2023, the store remains open to this day.
