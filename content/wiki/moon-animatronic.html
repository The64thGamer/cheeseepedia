The <b>Moon Animatronic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for ShowBiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983. It is a very simple figure, as its only movements are its raising from behind the backdrop and opening its mouth. Moon would later be used during {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}, where it would go unchanged.
<h2> Movements </h2>
Moon features 2 movements, being its head raise, and mouth.
