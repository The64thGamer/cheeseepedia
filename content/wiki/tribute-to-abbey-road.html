During <i>Louisiana,</i> CEI moved their drums into a warehouse for recording to provide proper reverberation. <i>Child of the Rock</i> has 15 children from a local elementary school provide the backup vocals.<sup>(1)</sup>

<h2> Trivia </h2><ul><li>This show was the first to feature Shalisa Sloan as the voice of Mitzi. She was only 11-years-old when she got the part.</li><li>This show was also the first to feature Rick Bailey as a lead vocalist, although not as Beach Bear, but as the Moon in 'Golden Slumbers'. Previously, he had done instrumental work and back-up vocals for the band, but this is his first time singing lead. He would end up replacing Aaron Fechter as the voice of Beach Bear in the following showtape, {{< wiki-link "RAE Christmas '82" >}}.</li><li>This is Aaron Fechter's final show recording any new vocals for Beach Bear. Anytime his Beach Bear voice is heard following this tape, it's through reused segments.</li><li>All of the segments from this showtape would go on to be reused in future compilation tapes.</li><li>At the time of it's release, the Abbey Road Medley was the longest individual segment on a Rock-afire showtape, clocking in at 14-minutes. This title has since been taken by longer tracks, however.</li></ul>
