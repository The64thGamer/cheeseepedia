<b><i>1431 22nd St, Store #958</b></i> was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on October 13, 1980 with a Rock-afire Explosion, which is still open to this day as a Chuck E. Cheese.
This location was the 5th ShowBiz to open, and the 4th RAE installed. West Des Moines would receive Concept Unification in April 1991 converting the show into a 3-Stage, being the last animatronic show in the state of Iowa. In July 2023, the store would start their 2.0 Remodel.
<h2> History </h2>
West Des Moines opened on October 13th, 1980 as a ShowBiz Pizza Place with a Rock-afire Explosion. This was the 1st ShowBiz in Iowa, the 4th Rock-afire Explosion installed, and the 5th ShowBiz to open. In 1981, the original animatronics were replaced due to structural issues. West Des Moines would become franchises in 1984 along with all other Iowa locations. In the late 1980s, West Des Moines received the 80s Remodel, which involved new decor, changed the exterior, added awnings above the counters, and received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground Upgrade. West Des Moines remained like this until April 1991, when they received Concept Unification. In September 1996, West Des Moines was sold to corporate. In early 1997, they received the 90s Remodel, which entirely refurbished the restaurant, and changing the exterior once again, and removed the SPP facade. In around 2008, they received the 00s Remodel, involving removing all 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls and removing balcony seating. The exterior was updated around 2011. In July 2023, West Des Moines received the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, West Des Moines had a Rock-afire Explosion. It was the 4th RAE installed, not the 3rd as some believe. This confusion comes from the animatronics having "0003" on their serial tags, but this was before CEI had a standard serial number format. The replaced animatronics were actually the 3rd of the 4-81 batch, and the original animatronics were the 4th of the 7-80 batch. The original animatronics were replaced in 1981 due to structural issues, along with all of the other 7-80 shows with the exception of Topeka, KS. In April 1991, West Des Moines would undergo Concept Unification. Until July 2023, West Des Moines still had the 3-Stage (With Building and Moon, albeit disabled), with it also being the last 3-Stage in Iowa, and also the last animatronic show in the state, as Davenport and Cedar Falls both received 2.0. Around 1997/1998, the original Rock-afire Fatz organ would catch on fire, leading to it being replaced with a Cyberamic organ. The Wink was removed sometime in the 2000s, with Building and Moon being disabled at the same time. The 3-Stage would be removed in July 2023 for a 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall.
