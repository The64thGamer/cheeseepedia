<h2> Stages </h2>
This location originally opened on March 24th, 1982, with the {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} stage. Not much information is known about its stage when it was a ShowBiz Pizza Place,
Around 1991/1992, this location underwent {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, converting the stage into a Munch's Make-Believe Band stage. It would undergo a few changes over the years. One of the highlights of this stage which made it unique was that Pasqually's drum had a black background instead of the usual white color.
On May 12th, 2013, after this store's closure, all 5 of the main bots were sent to the {{< wiki-link "San Antonio, TX (6874 Ingram Rd)" >}} location before the stage was replaced with a Circle of Lights stage in 2014.
