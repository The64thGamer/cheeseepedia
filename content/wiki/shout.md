***Shout*** is a live show which was released alongside {{< wiki-link "Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow" >}}. It featured the band programmed to sing the original Isley Brothers recording of ['Shout'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shout_(Isley_Brothers_song)) with Chuck E overlaid on top. This live show is considered lost media, with only the training video archived.
## Summary
The live show starts with a three-minute countdown featuring Mr. Mouth at the top of a theatre as CEC characters occasionally walk out and show cards revealing how many minutes there are until the live show. Mr. Mouth makes comments throughout the countdown, with one of them asking why the countdown is there in the first place. A CEC Cast Member would be required to answer Mr. Mouth with “Sorry, no.” After the countdown, the live show plays which is the original artist recording of ‘Shout’. In the middle of the live show, Chuck E. tells the audience to shake a leg, wiggle their nose, and wiggle their toes. Chuck E. then begins to sing-along briefly near the end of the song.
