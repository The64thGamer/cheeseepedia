<b><i>RetroMation</i></b> (formerly Rock-afire Remake) is a fanmade mod of {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Replay" >}} that started in January of 2021 which gained official support by Creative Engineering in 2024 to release, alongside CEI using the program for various official showtapes until {{< wiki-link "The Rock-afire Simulator" >}} releases.<sup>(1)(5)</sup>
<br>
The mod also has a build containing Chuck E. Cheese characters, which began passing around in private after the Cease & Desist of Reel to Real as to try to not be noticed and stopped as well, despite many public videos of this build in action being uploaded to YouTube since 2022.<sup>(2)(3)(4)</sup>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
The mod would begin development shortly after the cancellation of Rock-afire Replay, on January 6th, 2021. It would start out as a nonfunctional rip of the models from Rock-afire Replay, and stay that way until November 28th, 2021, when the team had finally figured out how to properly rip Rock-Afire Replay

<h3>Rename</h3>
On January 30th, 2022, Galla would make the decision to rename Rock-afire Remake to RetroMation, a combination of the words "Retro" and "Animation", as he felt it was a more fitting name for a mod that planned to have more than Creative Engineering content. This name has no connection to the Youtuber "Retromation". Another name, "Retronimation" was also proposed by another team member, as it more closely resembled "Electronimation", this name would go unused.

<h3>RetroMation "1.45"</h3>
On March 27, 2022, Coder "Sal" would reskin a Token Logger Virus into a file named "RetroMation 1.45". This would be used on multiple users before Galla was told by Sal, and after being told, Galla and 2 other developers who will remain unnamed, would then go on to use this for only a short amount of time to "Get back at all the leak supporters". They would quickly realize the severity of their actions, and take down everything possible related to it, along with deleting any information they had gained from the malware. Luckily, only a very small amount of people were affected by this malware. This would be a major event to permanently damage RetroMation's reputation, starting the rumor that RetroMation collects IP Addresses.
<h3>Source Code Updates</h3>
RetroMation's source code would undergo multiple updates to it's Source Code. Starting off as a rip of Rock-Afire Replay 1.24.1. Eventually, it became a rip of an unknown Faz-Anim version, this would happen twice. Unfortunately, the versions of these source codes cannot be verified as they're lost due to the Hard Drive in Galla's computer failing. Eventually, when The 64th Gamer would release Faz-Anim's source code, RetroMation would move to it's first officially released source code. RetroMation would also update alongside Reel to Real, until the cancellation of Reel to Real on December 9th, 2022. This is when RetroMation would settle on its current source code.
