**This page is slowly being dismantled and its info spread into each individual showtape page. Do not add any more info to this page, instead keep it inside the trivia section of the showtape page. If you take something from this page, be sure to delete it from the table, that way this page can be deleted as soon as possible once its usefulness is done.** Throughout the years, a number of stock music has been used in showtapes as instrumentals for songs, and background music for intermissions.

## Rock-afire Explosion

### ShowBiz Era

The earliest documented is in the 1984 Senior Citizen Show, with the second earliest being the 1984 Santa Show - often called 'Uncle Santa'. During the Classical music skit in the 5th segment (Ballroom Dancing), Fatz plays a complex piano piece called *Ballade No. 4 in F Minor, Op. 52.* It has since been found to be a recording from *Bella Davidovich.* Interestingly, Fatz says 'Hey, this guy's good!', which breaks the fourth wall of him actually playing it. Segment 4 of the same showtape (Startin' Something, Swingin' (Futuristic)) also utilises background audio while the Sun and Moon are joking about Lawrence Welk. The song playing in the background is called [*The Starlit Hour*](https://youtu.be/b6B0KNs7iSs?t=144). The Uncle Santa showtape contained the song instrumentals of *Holly Jolly Christmas* and *Jingle Jingle Jingle*. These were taken from the *Rudolph [The Red Nosed Reindeer Soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_%28soundtrack%29)* album which was recorded by the *Decca Concert Orchestra*. The second Santa segment also used *Holly Jolly Christmas* as the background music. The first segment also used an extract from John Klein's *Christmas Sound Spectacular Medley* which contained the cover of *Santa Claus Is Coming To Town*. In Segment 1 of the 1987 *Homely For Christmas* showtape, a selection of songs from Act 1 of the *Nutcracker Ballet by Sir Charles Mackerras &amp; London Symphony Orchestra* was used, that being *Act 1 Scene 2 (March)* and *Act 1 Scene 5 (Scene and Grandfather's Dance)*. In the song 'Venus' in the *Tune Machine 2* showtape, a sample from [James Brown's *Living In America*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_in_America_%28James_Brown_song%29) was used, of which the moon is programmed to say.

### 90's Era

In the 1990's CEI used karaoke tracks made by *Midifine Systems*, *BFM Hits*, and other unknown sources for their shows. These were especially used for their karaoke stages, in which a participant could sing along to the lyrics displayed on a video screen. Some companies shared tracks for certain songs, meaning some artists stated may be inaccurate.
