<h2> History </h2>
Glendale opened on June 29, 2005 with the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included some mid 2000s decor, {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} (known as Chuck E.'s Clubhouse during this time), and the Studio C Beta stage. One interesting thing about this location is that this was the 500th modern CEC location to open, according to advertisements.<sup>(1)</sup> However, in May 2020 (day unknown), the location closed permanently. A weird thing is that the Google Maps information about this location stated the location was temporarily closed, but it has been changed. As of 2024, it is remodeling to become a Dollar Tree.
