***2945 Argentia Road***, also known as ***Argentia***, is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in January 12, 2006 with the Studio C Beta, 16m stage and is still open to this day. It is located around a few unnamed shopping centers. It's also not to be confused with {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)" >}} which opened in the Spring of 1991 (most likely around March or April) with a Road Stage and it's also open to this day.

## History

Mississauga (Argentia) opened on January 12th, 2006 as the 22nd Chuck E. Cheese to open in all of Canada, and it's somewhat a standalone store. It also opened with the 2005 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. Mississauga (Argentia) remained like this until April 2023 when it would receive the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}. This is the first Canadian Chuck E. Cheese location to receive the 2.0 remodel. As of August 2023, Mississauga (Argentia) still remains like this with the 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall.

## Stages

Mississauga (Argentia) opened with the Studio C Beta, 16m in January 2006. The Studio C Beta was removed with the 2.0 Remodel in April 2023, and replaced with the 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall.
