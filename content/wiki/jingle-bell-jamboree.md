The Jingle Bell Jamboree (Stylized as JINGLEBELL JAMBOREE) was an Animatronic Show at Santa's Village in Jefferson, New Hampshire from 1977 until it's Removal in 2016. The Show was originally built by Creative Engineering as it's first full show, but was later changed to have Advanced Animations Animatronics from 2009 to 2010.


## History


### Production


The Show originally began production in 1977 as 'The Santa Claus Revue'{{< cite 1 >}} by Creative Engineering. The Concept Art showcased Left stage with Rudolph, Center Stage with the 3 Elves, Right Stage with Santa, and Elfis and Ms Claus on the Side Walls. The Show was created for Santa's Village unlike previous CEI Animatronics & Attractions.


### Creative Engineering


Jingle Bell Jamboree was installed at an unknown time in 1977 in Santa's Village's Jingle Bell Theater{{< cite 2 >}}. The Show differed from Concept Art, scrapping Ms Claus and having Elfis be in the Center of Center Stage after Rudolph's Segment using a Trap Door. The Show also installed 3 small Animal Animatronics. The Show was originally installed with Three 8-Track Reels, but CEI later took a private flight to Santa's Village in 1979 to install a new CEI 4-Track Reel Showtape as a sign of appreciation{{< cite 2 >}}.
The Show eventually began to break down, and began removal in 2006{{< cite 3 >}}.


### Advanced Animations


Santa's Village would get Advanced Animation's to redo the Show alongside the Outside Rudolph Head which was also originally developed by Creative Engineering, Creating Concept art and Building the Animatronics between 2009-2010. In 2009, The Show was retrofitted into a Half Animatronic Half Live show called the 'Jingle Bell Talent Show'{{< cite 4 >}}. The Talent Show only Used Rudolph and Elfin John's animatronic retrofitted into an unknown Elf character.


The Show was finished and installed in 2010, using the original showtape. The Show removed the 3 Smaller Animals, and later removed the Red backdrop on the Top Art. The Show continued to run until 2016, in which it was removed.


## Design


### Overall Stage


The Overall Stage included Red Curtain's and a red floor over the wood the stage was built from. Art with a Red backdrop and Santa riding His sleigh alongside 2 Elves was placed above the Stage. the Art was later changed to remove the Red backdrop. The Stage also had decorations around it.


### Left Stage


The Show's Left Stage contained Rudolph on with a Black Backdrop.


### Center Stage


Center Stage contained Multiple Animatronics. From left to right the Stage had a gray Dog, Elfin John on piano, a white Rabbit on the piano, Satchmo on the trumpet, Maynard on Bass, and a black/dark gray Cat.


The Stage contained a Custom Carpet with a smaller red Carpet on top of it in the center. The Stage also contained Stockings and a Fire place under a Picture, alongside a Large Christmas Tree.


Elfis would come out of a black trap door.


the Show later removed and changed many of these features including removing the Animals and changing Elfin John's Piano's design. The Backdrop was changed to replace the picture, added presents, removed the stockings, removed the tree, and added façade windows. The Floor also removed the old carpet for a black carpet.
