***Me &amp; My Friends*** is a live show released with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's Show 3 2017" >}} in April 2017. It was re-edited in 2021 to remove mentions of the *Ticket Splash*, alongside redoing the countdown of the show.

## Summary

### Countdowns
The initial countdown was seven minutes on Studio C and five minutes on Existing Stages. It featured the countdown host trying to hunt down Chuck E. The first scene shows the host in the gameroom announcing the live show. The next scene shows the host checking in on Chuck E. backstage and finding him taking a nap. In scene three, the host wakes up Chuck E. with the help of the audience, and he hurries to get ready before the live show. Scene four is the host in the gameroom telling guests to take a picture with Chuck E. after the show and share it on social media. Scene five shows Chuck E. in the 'Hair &amp; Make-up' room, with the hairdresser mistaking him for Munch.  After this, it transitions to teaching the guests about how to do the dance, which then leads to the live show.

The 2021 Countdown was seven minutes on Studio C and five minutes on Existing Stages, and simply just text showing the amount of time left overtop of the curtains, with Matt Daniel announcing the amount of time left after every minute. At the two-minute mark, the How-To video from 2017 is played. The instrumentals of 'Lend a Helping Hand' and 'Because We're Friends' are played in the background. The countdown was shortened to five minutes for all stages with Evergreen 2022.

### Main Live Show
The show is a listing of Chuck E.'s friends and their attributes, with Chuck E. and the audience mimicking them in the dance. Helen is brought up first, with the audience instructed to 'flap their wings'. Pasqually is next, where the audience's hands are instructed to spin pointing up, mimicking the tossing of pizza dough. Then comes Munch, where an arm gesture is made to resemble a jaw 'munching' on food. Jasper comes next, where the audience pretends to scratch like a dog. Chuck then refers to himself, telling the audience to 'wiggle their ears' like him by waving their hands over their heads. After this lesson on the dance moves, they are done in rapid succession to a song, alongside spinning, and the audience waving their hands to each side. Chuck E. concludes that since the audience now knows of his friends, the song can end. The live show originally ended with a ticket splash, though this was removed in 2021 due to physical tickets being retired. It was replaced with curtains closing and the 2017 2.0 logo fading in.

## Trivia:
- It originally released with Show 1 2021 on Studio C/Weigl, but wasn't able to be played. It was then playable with the Show 1 2021 (Covid Promo Update), before finally being released across all stages with Show 1 2021 (Ryan's FanFest World Promo).
