***Me &amp; My Friends*** is a live show released with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 3 2017" >}}. Then in 2021 they made cuts to the *Ticket Splash*, alongside redoing the initial countdown of the show.

## Summary

The show is a listing of Chuck E.'s friends and their attributes, with Chuck E. and the audience mimicking them in the dance. Helen is brought up first, with the audience instructed to 'flap their wings'. Pasqually is next, where the audience's hands are instructed to spin pointing up, mimicking the tossing of pizza dough. Then comes Munch, where an arm gesture is made to resemble a jaw 'munching' on food. Jasper comes next, where the audience pretends to scratch like a dog. Chuck then refers to himself, stating the audience to 'wiggle their ears' like him by waving their hands on top of their head. After this lesson of the dance moves, they are done in rapid succession to a song alongside spinning and the audience waving their hands to each side. Chuck E. concludes that since the audience now knows of his friends, the song can end.

## Live Show Trivia:

Scene 1 is located in the arcade, Scene 2 &amp; 3 are located in Chuck E.'s Room, Scene 4 is in the arcade again and Scene 5 is located in the 'Hair &amp; Make-up' Room. After this it transitions to teaching the guests about how to do the dance then the live show itself.
- The 2021 Countdown is 7 minutes long. At the start it showcases 'Me &amp; My Friends' at the top telling people what live will begin once the countdown is over.
- At the end of every minute Matt Daniel says the amount of time left until the live show. Despite the fact if you just looked at the screen you could obviously tell.
- The countdown track are instrumentals for various CEC songs released in the past few years. The songs in order are Lend a Helping Hands Instrumental, and Because We're Friends Instrumental.
- At the two minute mark it fades into the original countdown giving instructions on how to do the live show.
- The Ticket Splash is replaced with purple curtains closing with the 2017 2.0 logo using the stock cheering sound effect until the live show ends.
