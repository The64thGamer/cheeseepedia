The <b>Traveler (Magazine)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel. It can currently be found at the 1001 Commons Dr., Dothan, AL location.

The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Traveler (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Summer vacation wearing sun glasses, Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and shoes. In the background behind the Statue is a Flamingo wearing sun glasses also.
