<b><i>Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd), Store #471</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in August 1983 and closed on March 31st, 2018.
<h2>History</h2>
Newington opened in August 1983 as a franchise-owned Pizza Time Theatre location, owned by Dolli & Associates<sup>(1)</sup>. It opened with the Balcony Stage and Dolli Dimples in the Lounge room.
Sometime in the mid 1980's, Newington would replace Dolli with the Beach Bowzers. Around the same time, Newington was bought by the corporate on February 2nd, 1987, along with {{< wiki-link "Manchester, NH (1525 S Willow St)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Danvers, MA (139 Endicott St)" >}}.
Newington later received the 1988 Remodel in 1989. Converting the Balcony Stage into the C-Stage in the process. They also ended up swapping cabaret shows with Danvers, as Danvers would receive the Newington Bowzers, and Newington would receive the Danvers King. They would also keep the PTT Lettering on the exterior with this remodel, which ended up being retained all the way up to the 2005 Remodel.
Around Fall 1996, Newington would receive the 1993 Remodel. Converting the C-Stage into a 2-Stage. The King was removed from the Lounge Room, allegedly making Newington one of the last surviving Kings in a store. The Lounge Room would remain however, as well as The Kings stage (albeit with The Video Velociter in his place). They also put a separate 2-Stage fiber optic sign in the room, making Newington one of the only 1993 Remodels to still utilize the former Lounge Room area in this manner. Skytubes were also added.
In November 2005, Newington would receive the 2005 Remodel. The 2-Stage would remain, and the Skytubes would be downsized and relocated to the back of the store, The Toddler Zone would be placed in the former Lounge Room area, and the Balcony and Showroom walls would be demolished. Around Summer 2008, the 2-Stage would go through a huge cosmetic overhaul. Every character would receive a new mask (except for Jasper), and Chuck E's Tuxedo would be replaced by the Cool Chuck outfit.
In January 2018, it was announced that Planet Fitness, which previously had its headquarters located next to Chuck E. Cheese's, who were also owners of the entire property, sold the property to the furniture store, Bernie and Phyl's. This announcement meant Chuck E. Cheese's would be forced to shut down to make way for the new property. Shortly after the announcement, Newington would close permanently on March 31st, 2018. There were talks of a possible relocation, but unfortunately this never came into fruition. By Summer 2018, the building would be completely gutted, and Bernie and Phyl's would open by 2019.
