***CEC September 1990 Show*** is a showtape released in the Fall of 1990 for the 3-Stage and Cyberamics, it's currently the last known showtape to use the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Reel" >}} format.

## Low Production Count

The 3-Stage version was only seen in a handful of locations that got converted to the new MMBB stage. The current ones known are:

- {{< wiki-link "Dallas, TX (13125 Montfort Dr)" >}}
- {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (3200 Justiss Dr)" >}}
- {{< wiki-link "Altamonte Springs, FL (541 W Hwy 436)" >}}
- Mesa (West), AZ (856 S Alma School Rd)
- {{< wiki-link "Phoenix, AZ (8039 North 35th Ave)" >}}

## Production

### Filming Locations

- 'Rhythm of the Night' was filmed in downtown Fort Worth, TX.

### APS Files

The show was a part of the {{< wiki-link "1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases" >}}, being the first tape known to be made using APS. Only it's 3-Stage files were placed in the collection, making it unknown if the Cyberamics version was also programmed in APS, or was still using {{< wiki-link "SongCode" >}} for its programming.

#### Floppy Disk Label

It's floppy disk label notes it as the 'Full Stage' disk, a pseudo name given to the 3-Stage. The Cyberamics were also given the term 'Half Stage' during this time. 'SEPT 1' .APS FILES 'SEPT 2' 'SEPT 3' FULL STAGE 10-90 disk # 90-7

#### Files

All three segments' files were last updated on October 10, 1990, a month after the tape's release. Unlike other APS file dates, which correlate with when the show was done, this show's dates most likely correlate to when they were uploaded onto the floppy disc, as it is the first disc in the collection, and likely not the originating disc used to make the show.
