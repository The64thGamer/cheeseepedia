<h2> Trivia: </h2><ul><li>All songs from this show were redubbed originally in {{< wiki-link "December 2012 Show" >}}. With them originally coming from {{< wiki-link "Holiday 2002" >}}.</li><li>Despite CEC no longer using Duncan's voice for over a year they decided to use 'Dreidel Song' from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Holiday Party 1999" >}}. The footage was not changed nor was the voice cast.</li><li>This was the final showtape with curtains as the programming for the songs hadn't been touched since 2002. But due to the songs being cut apart some songs only have curtain open and some only have curtain close</li><li>This was the final show with Cupid Shuffle. For this show, the avenger walkaround was edited back in after being removed with the rockstar redub.</li><li>This was also the final show to use the old 1999 Puppets. While the footage was the same from {{< wiki-link "Holiday 2002" >}} Helen, Munch, Jasper and Pasqually would no longer be seen  after this point using their old puppets.</li><li>Ken Chuck E. Derby and Larry The Technican were added after not being presented in the previous year's show.</li><li>The Timecode part of this show is a clip from Sesame Street with the text <i>'Merry Christmas Michael! Thanks for all that you do.'.</i></li><li>Baking with Betty was slightly reeditied to give a VHS scan line effect over any shot with Betty in it. This is because they wouldn't be able to push the footage into 16:9 without cropping out most of the footage.</li><li>'Play Some Games For The Holidays' is a 30 second ad about downloading the song on their facebook page. Using footage from the commercial.</li></ul>
