TODO: Some more details.

## Notes

- Features the {{< wiki-link "1982 Articulated Chuck Walkaround" >}}.
- Some scenes from the commercial, like Chuck appearing out the balloons, Howie blowing out the birthday cake, Mr. Munch coming up close to a child and the girl taking apart her pizza, also appeared in print promotional material.
- Harmony Howlette makes a brief cameo in the commercial in animatronic form.
- Donkey Kong and Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinets can both be seen in the commercial.
- If you look closely at the scene before Chuck winks, the Chuck E. Cheese carousel can be seen.
