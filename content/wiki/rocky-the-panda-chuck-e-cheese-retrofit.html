<b><i>Rocky The Panda</b></i> is a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese (Cyberamic)" >}} created by Sally Corp for {{< wiki-link "Ocean City, NJ (600 Boardwalk)" >}}. Rocky is the leader of Rocky & The Railroad Ramblers, an animatronic show near Gillian's train ride.
The Bot was first installed in 1992 & was placed right of Bubba (Mr. Munch Retrofit)|Bubba & Left of Henrietta Hatpin (Helen Henny Retrofit)|Henrietta Hatpin.
<h2> History </h2>
It is unknown currently what PTT or CEC Rocky is from, though he is most likely from a New Jersey Location. In 1992, Gillian's would buy the Animatronics & hire Sally Corp to create cosmetics & Showtapes for them. Rocky was placed on a box near the left side of the stage.
In 2001 or 2002, Rocky would gain new cosmetics, giving him a brown shirt. The bot had these new cosmetics up until 2015, when the bot replaced his brown shirt for a handkerchief on his neck.
<h2> Design </h2>
Rocky is a Black & White Panda Bear with blue eyes, brown pants, & a handkerchief on his neck. He originally had no handkerchief when he was first installed & had a brown shirt from 2001 / 2002 up until 2015.
