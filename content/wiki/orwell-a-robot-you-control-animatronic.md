## History

### Concept Art & Origin

Orwell's bot was originally meant to be a standing mech in a box with a control module. It's unknown if this would have been a Klunk retrofit or new mech.

### In Store

#### Beta/Cosmetic less Version

Orwell was originally a bare Klunk mech that was installed in the gameroom of an unknown ShowBiz store. He would be given a token before speaking some lines. His mechanisms could be controlled using a control module.
Here's a transcript of Beta Orwell's Audio

> Orwell: 'Hello, My name is Orwell. I am here to obey Your every command. I have been programmed so you control my movements by pushing the buttons in front of you. I'm ready, when You are.'

#### Final/Split Body Version

The Final Version of Orwell had a different voice & Split Body Country Klunk cosmetics. During Orwell's run, an odd pin was created saying, 'I PUSHED ORWELL'S BUTTONS'.

### Fate

The bot was most likely either sold or destroyed at an unknown time.

## Design
