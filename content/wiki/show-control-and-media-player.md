**Show Control And Media Player**, or SCAMP, is a control system purported to be a replacement for the various existing Chuck E Cheese control systems. Known to be installed in only three locations as of September 2016, very little is known about this system other than that it uses flash memory for storage and is capable of 1080p video playback.
From the single available photo<sup>(1)</sup> and locations cited in a forum post<sup>(2)</sup>, it can be assumed that this currently exists as a drop-in replacement for the Show Computer in the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Control System" >}}, connecting to the existing DTUs for character and light control. A since-removed Wikipedia edit suggests it would support output formats compatible with the control systems from other CEC stage types, not only the Studio C system.<sup>(3)</sup>
