<b><i>191 N McKinley St, Store #407</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on May 19, 1992, as a corporate location with a Road Stage which is still open to this day with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}.
It is located next to Denny's that closed in 2020 and a gas station like {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}.
<h2>History</h2>
Corona opened on May 19th, 1992, as a corporate-owned location. Corona opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the Mid 1990's, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor, the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. In 1999-2001, they would receive {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} which includes an expansion to make room for more games and replacing the Record Posters for Must C TV ones and adding some new decor. Corona remained like this until in Summer 2007, when they received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}. which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, & adding purple walls; they managed to keep the dim lighting. In around the Early 2010's, some of the decor such as the Dinner Lights and the sign above the Kid Check were removed. Corona remained like this until they remodeled to the 2.0 remodel between February-March 2024. Currently, as of May 2024, the location still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Like all Road Stages when they first opened, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Also, the stage featured no curtains like any other Road Stage from when it was first installed. The lift curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000's, this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. The lift curtains were later removed. In December of 2015, Chuck E. would lose his teeth and would stay that way until April of 2021 when the stage was refurbished with Chuck E. getting new teeth in the process. In 2022, the door was painted black, possibly to prepare for the 2.0 remodel that would happen eventually. Later in 2023, they would receive the Trampoline Zone despite not being remodeled to 2.0.
In February 2024, Corona would start their 2.0 remodel and would remove their Road Stage not long after for the Dance Floor.
