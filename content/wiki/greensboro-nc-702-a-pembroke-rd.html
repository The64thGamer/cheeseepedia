<h2> History </h2>
Greensboro opened on October 22nd, 1984 as the fifth ShowBiz Pizza Place in North Carolina (5th after {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Fayetteville, NC (511 North McPherson Church Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Asheville, NC (34 Tunnel Rd)" >}}, & {{< wiki-link "Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr)" >}}) as a Franchised owned store. Greensboro originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. Greensboro would have it for a few years, until around May/June 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, adding Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, added checkers around inside and outside the store, and removing all SPP decor for CEC decor.
In the Mid-Late 1990's Greensboro would receive the 1990s Major Remodel along with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} game packages. By 2000, the store would have their record posters replaced with Must C TV posters which they had until 2009 when the store would receive the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls (Downsizing the showroom to make room for more games), adding bright florescent lighting, redoing the walls on the sides of the 3-Stage and numerous other changes. Around 2013, Greensboro was supposed to expand the store into the Catherine's next door, which would have removed the 3-Stage for what could have been North Carolina's only {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} stage, but due to restrictions, that didn't happen. During the same time, the store would remove their Avenger sign on the exterior for a Rockstar sign. The store would remove their Helicopter Light in around 2021-2022, they store would then become the first location in North Carolina to remodel to the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel in June 2022 (After a couple delays) which marked the 3-Stage's removal.
The 2.0 remodel retained Greensboro's existing front doors, cashwrap countertops, salad bars, soda machines, and back-of-house equipment. New paint, signage, ticket blaster, carpeting, and other common 2.0 features were installed. Greensboro's Grand Reopening would happen on August 4th, 2022. After Greensboro's stage removal, the last CEC store located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_Triad"> Piedmont Triad area</a> that had animatronics was the {{< wiki-link "Winston-Salem, NC (620 Hanes Mall Blvd)" >}} with their {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}, but it was removed on March 26, 2023 when they started their 2.0 remodel.
As of June 2023, Greensboro still has the 2.0 Remodel and 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall.
