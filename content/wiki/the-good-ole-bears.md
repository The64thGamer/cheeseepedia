## Info

The Good Ole Bears were created by a UK company called Golding Leisure, who specialised in animatronic shows and theming for theme parks.
The show was created in 1987 for the American Adventure Theme Park in Ilkeston, Derbyshire.
Their names are as follows:

- Fiddlin' Fred Bear (fiddle)
- Joe On Bass
- Spitter / Pickin' Billy (banjo)
- Ole Pa Bear (harmonica)
- Hank (Honky-Tonk)
- Unknown Squirrel (I call him sammy lmao)

## Nineties

In the 90s, the entrance to the American Adventure would be relocated, and the old entrance where the bears used to sit was reused so people could get into the park's soft play area, but they remained, with a new refurb and showtape, the bears looked worse than before.
The bears would go on to perform for the American Adventure until the park closed in 2007, which led to the bears being sold to Gulliver's Kingdom in Matlock.

## Gulliver's

The bears were relocated to the western world area of the park, with a new gazebo. The old one was given to an automaton band in the same park.
The bears were practically untouched since the 90s, leaving them to start to deteriorate. Sawdust was caught in all their fur, and they got incredibly sunbleached.
They would remain like this until 2023, when instagram user @xan_rockafire_fan would come in and give them a full restoration.

## Restoration

The Bears were given a full repaint, refur, new lights, and new shows, which they remain like to this day.

## Showtapes

## Other Notes

There was also some merchandise and mascot costumes made of Fred for American Adventure but I won't get into those, someone else can add em if they like.
