The Mitzi Mozzarella Animatronic (Also the 3-Stage Helen Henny Animatronic) was one of the main {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} animatronics produced by Creative Engineering Inc. The animatronic would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} on August 14th of that year. Her character was based off Mini Mozzarella from the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} animatronic show Creative Engineering had developed.
<h2> History </h2>
Mitzi Mozzarella animatronics would continue to be produced up until 1983. The January batch would be the last used inside ShowBiz Pizza restaurants, and would be kept and stored for future openings, while Creative Engineering would continue to produce bots until June. Now with a surplus of bots, these would need to be sold to other family entertainment centers.
During {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, Mitzi Mozzarella would now become Helen Henny<i>,</i> sporting a similar dress, pigtails, green or blue makeup, and a neck ruffle. The only mechanical change was the lowering of air pressure for her movements, and later diagnostic changes to the air flow in the cylinders. Another process which some stores would also choose not to go forward with. In April of 2001 a major change would come for all 3-Stage bots in stores. Their previously latex masks would now be changed out for furred plastic ones, to reduce costs for the rapidly deteriorating latex. Around this time stores would also be offered the ability to purchase new eyes for their 3-Stage characters, now with smaller pupils and more detailed irises. Store owners were also encouraged to repaint the eyelids with Rust-Oleum Painters Touch spray paint.
<h2> Design </h2>
The bot is a grey mouse in cheerleading attire, holding green pom-poms. She has two ears, beige skin, a white sweater with a green 'M' embroidered onto it, and black shoes.
<h2> Mechanical Structure </h2>
<h3> Movements </h3>
The bot features nineteen movements in total. No movements were removed during Concept Unification, unlike {{< wiki-link "Rolfe Dewolfe & Earl Schmerle (Animatronic)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}} because the ear mechanism was used for Helen pigtails
