The <b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Winchester Hardware Setup</b></i> was the system used to program the animatronics exclusively at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} from May 1977 to sometime between 1980 and 1981.
The system was developed by the Cyan Engineering subdivision of Atari (also known as the <i>Grass Valley Team</i>), headed by Larry Emmons and Gary Waters<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> Hardware </h2>
<h3> PDP-11/70 </h3>
The main programming computer would be the <i>PDP-11/70,</i> running the Winchester Programmer software for generating programming data. It is unclear if any terminal was used to program the characters, or to make the software itself.
<h3> TEAC 4-Track Tape Deck </h3>
An unnamed TEAC 4-Track tape deck would be used to record audio and programming signals. The Winchester 4-Track Reel would be the format used for data, where audio, programming signals, and a timecode track would be streamed in real time.
Due to the later {{< wiki-link "SongCode Hardware Setup" >}} using a TEAC A-2340 Tape Deck, which seemingly recorded only in the <i>2-track stereo-mode,</i> it is a possibility that this was a carryover from the Winchester store, giving this unnamed tape deck a likely model.
<h2> Live Playback </h2>
It is unclear how the system, if at all, connected to the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Control System" >}} for controlling the animatronics. Multiple statements about the programming of the Winchester system vaguely imply that all programming was done in a separate room, blind to visual feedback or any sort of live playback system. Statements about the process being <b>trial and error</b> and having to <b>program to the Teac tape player and run through until everything was synchronized</b><sup>(1)</sup> gives rise to the possibility of it being the only programming system out of the company's history that didn't have access to visual programming.
