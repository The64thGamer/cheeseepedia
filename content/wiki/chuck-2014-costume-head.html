The <b><i>Chuck 2014 (Costume Head)</b></i> was a minor design update to the Chuck 2013 (Costume Head) in 2014.
<h2> Production </h2>
After months of being officially rolled out to every store, the “Rockstar Chuck” walkaround received a minor update. These updates included; new sculpt designed to have a more narrow face, plastic attachment for screwing down rubber teeth, mask attachment inside the head used to keep the eye mesh in place. This design update was the final standardized look for Rockstar, adding in head attachments for performer comfort and convenience.
Previously, without these new attachments, it was quite easy for eyes and teeth to fall off the head, these new attachments offer a safeguard insuring minimized issues.
