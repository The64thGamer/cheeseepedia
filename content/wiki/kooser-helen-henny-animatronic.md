***Kooser Helen Henny* was a Guest Star animatronic featured at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} Pizza Time Theatre. She was alternated with other guest stars until 1980, when Kooser would upgrade to the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}**

## History

After Kooser upgraded to the Balcony show, Helen's whereabouts were unknown. It's assumed she was moved to {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}}, but unlike {{< wiki-link "Kooser Chuck E Cheese (Animatronic)" >}}, there are no pictures of her at Sunnyvale. She is currently presumed to have been destroyed when Sunnyvale relocated to {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}} after PTT's bankruptcy.

## Design

Kooser Helen is an upgraded version of {{< wiki-link "Winchester Helen Henny (Animatronic)" >}}. She has long brown hair, brown eyes, and wears a black necklace with a gold and black medallion. She wears a white shirt with a purple vest. She carries a guitar and has yellow hands with red painted talons/fingernails.
