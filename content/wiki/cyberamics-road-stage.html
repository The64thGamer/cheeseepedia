The <b><i>Road Stage</b></i> was the first ever Cyberamic setup for Munch's Make-Believe Band.
It is a stage format found at Chuck E. Cheese's locations, which either opened with the stage or replaced a previous stage from 1990 - 1992, and 1994. 
<h2> History </h2>
After the creation of the Concept Unification 3-Stage in 1990, ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. wanted a Cyberamic setup for Munch's Make-Believe Band to create synergy and unity between Chuck E. Cheese's shows after been producing Chuck E.’s Houses (Rocker Stages) and Chuck E.'s House Facades (C-Stages) based around the rapidly changing Pizza Time Players. The Road Stage was created as a solution to this, designed by Director of Entertainment at the time Jul Kamen.<sup>(1)</sup>The premise of the Road Stage was not too far off from the idea of the 3-Stage in theme. However, the execution of which would be drastically different in comparison of which. The stage would be replaced through 1994 - 2025 by 1-Stages, 2-Stages, and Dance Floors. The final Road Stage would be removed on June 15, 2025.
<h2> Appearance</h2>
<h3> Road Stage Prototype</h3>Chuck E. Cheese was positioned atop a black platform with a white surface. His star, directly from the 3-Stage setup, A custom-designed neon sign accompanied Chuck E. and was installed within a set of buildings situated between him and Helen. Behind Mr. Munch, a large jukebox-style television displayed the Cyberstar/CEC TV video feed from above. Helen and Jasper were placed on building-like structures, based on the description in the 1990 CEC Stage diagnostics<sup>(2)</sup>; no cityscape backdrops are present behind them. Pasqually features an abstract design that features the text, "Pasqually's". Mr. Munch is placed on an organ, while Pasqually is seated on a drum set. This is absent on the final design. The early version of the stage lacked both a valance and a wink, and included a road element encircling the stage area.
<h3> Road Stage </h3>
Chuck E. Cheese is positioned on a black platform with a white surface. Behind him is the star identical in design to the one used in the 3-Stage setup. Further behind the star is a backdrop consisting of buildings. The monitor, originally located behind Mr. Munch, has been relocated next to Chuck E. Cheese. Its design is modeled after the 'Jukebox' cover used in the 3-Stage format, with an additional extension at the base to increase its height. A 'Jukebox' light, matching the 3-Stage version, has been installed at the top. Above this, a neon sign which was also redesigned to reflect the 3-Stage version. The stage backdrop features a cityscape with multi-colored windows, and a "Munch's Make Believe Band" sign is positioned behind Mr. Munch. Helen and Jasper are situated atop enlarged building structures. Mr. Munch is placed on an organ, while Pasqually is seated on a drum set. The road featured in front of the stage would be removed, with the wink and valance added to standardize more of the design with the 3-Stage.
<h3> Debut </h3>
The first Road Stage debuted on November 20th, 1990, at the Jonesboro, Georgia location, which was then followed by Springfield, PA on December 4th, 1990, and then West Palm Beach, FL on December 18th, 1990. These three locations had the prototype Road Stage as described above, and all would eventually receive a more finalized design within a few years of installation. Also in December 1990, the Topeka, KS location would open with a Road Stage, being the first to receive said finalized design but keeping the road from the prototype (which stores afterward would leave out).<sup>(3)</sup>
Curtains were not originally a part of this stage's design, but many installations from 1991 - 1992 would include them making them the first Cyberamic stages to have curtains be utilized just like 3-Stages would (Using Austrian lift instead of side-to-side).
<h3>Munch & Pasqually Armature Retrofits.</h3>
While not originally part of the Road Stage, Mr. Munch and Pasqually figures would retain their armatures from the Pizza Time Theatre era in a majority of initial installations. When the 2-Stage was rolled out in 1992, Road Stages would begin to replace these armatures with new, appropriate arms by Kinetix so both Munch and Pasqually could play the organ and drums properly respectively. Albeit some of these would be very different than 2-Stage and 1-Stage armatures in positioning alone, making them more unique.
This stage would be the final time Mr. Munch and Pasqually Cyberamics would have body turns along with their head turns be standard as since the creation of the 2-Stage and 1-Stage, it was instructed to secure the body turn mechanism down by removing the shoulder strap pins/stop plates and bolting a 1 1/2* 'L' bracket to the front of their base supports. This means only both their heads could turn freely, but their bodies cannot so they can thus play their instruments without the possible risk of wear or damage from their restricted surroundings on those stages.<sup>(4)</sup>
