The <b><i>Road Stage</b></i> was the first ever Cyberamic setup for Munch's Make-Believe Band.
This stage type was placed in both in existing stores and all new stores from the years 1990 to 1992. It would be one out of three Cyberamic stages to revolve around MMBB (other two being 2-Stage and 1-Stage) and one of four stages to revolve around MMBB overall (counting the 3-Stage).
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Design </h3>
After the creation of the Concept Unification 3-Stage in 1989, ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. wanted a Cyberamic setup for Munch's Make-Believe Band to create synergy and unity between Chuck E. Cheese's shows after been producing Chuck E.’s Houses (Rocker Stages) and Chuck E.'s House Facades (C-Stages) based around the rapidly changing Pizza Time Players. The Road Stage was created as a solution to this, designed by Director of Entertainment at the time Jul Kamen.<sup>(1)</sup>The premise of the Road Stage was not too far off from the idea of the 3-Stage in theme. However, the execution of which would be drastically different in comparison of which. The following below describes the original design intended to be for this first incarnation. Originally, Chuck E.'s star was taken directly from the 3-Stage, making it look much larger. His neon sign was a custom design and was placed inside a set of buildings located between himself and Helen. Mr. Munch would have a large Jukebox TV behind him, playing the video feed of Cyberstar/CEC TV from up behind. Helen and Jasper would position on 'buildings' according to the 1990 CEC Stage diagnostics<sup>(2)</sup> (which wouldn't change past the prototypes) and initially didn't have city backdrops behind them.  Finally, Pasqually had a unique abstract backdrop implied to be his pizzeria, 'Pasqually's.' There would be a lack of a valance or wink in this early version but would feature a road going around the stage (hence the name).
<h3> Debut </h3>
The first Road Stage debuted on November 20th, 1990, at the Jonesboro, Georgia location; which was then followed by Springfield, PA on December 4th, 1990; and then West Palm Beach, FL on December 18th, 1990. These three locations had the prototype Road Stage as described above and all would eventually receive a more finalized design within a few years of installation. Also in December 1990, the Topeka, KS location would open with a Road Stage, being the first to receive said finalized design but keeping the road from the prototype (which stores afterward would leave out).<sup>(3)</sup>
This second incarnation had a smaller star for Chuck E. compared to the 3-Stage stars, and his neon sign being taken from the 3-Stage itself. The Jukebox TV being relocated in between Chuck E. and Helen and recolored pink and gold (originally was green and red). Helen and Jasper would receive their own city building backdrops while Pasqually loses his unique backdrop in favor of expanding the cityscape. The buildings that originally held the neon sign were relocated behind Mr. Munch and were repurposed to hold the Munch's Make-Believe Band logo within the spot. The valance and wink would finally be added here and as explained above, the namesake road would be removed entirely opting out for a simple stage base.
Curtains were not originally a part of this stage's design, but several installations (primarily those in 1991 and 1992) would include them making them one of if not the first Cyberamic stages to have curtains be utilized just like 3-Stages would (except being Austrian lift instead of side-to-side).
<h3> Later Installations </h3>
Also, not originally part of the Road Stage, Mr. Munch and Pasqually figures would retain their armatures from the Pizza Time Theatre era in a majority of initial installations. When the 2-Stage was rolled out in 1992, Road Stages were given the opportunity to replace these armatures with new, appropriate arms by Kinetix so both Munch and Pasqually could play the organ and drums properly respectively. Albeit some of these would be very different than 2-Stage and 1-Stage armatures in positioning alone, making them more unique.
This stage would be the final time Mr. Munch and Pasqually Cyberamics would be allowed to have body turns along with their head turns as since the creation of the 2-Stage and 1-Stage, it was instructed to secure the body turn mechanism down by removing the shoulder strap pins/stop plates and bolting a 1 1/2* 'L' bracket to the front of their base supports. This means only both their heads could turn freely, but their bodies cannot so they can thus play their instruments without the possible risk of wear or damage from their restricted surroundings on those stages.<sup>(4)</sup>
