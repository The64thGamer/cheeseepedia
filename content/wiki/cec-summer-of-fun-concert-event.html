<h2> Trivia: </h2><ul><li>Play All You Can Play replaces Chucks vocals with helens during his 'Solo' and then replaces Munch's vocals with Helens during his 'Solo'</li><li>Dog Days of Summer removes the rest of backing vocals and has Helen be the only backup singer and also sings some of Jaspers lines.</li><li>Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Song re-recorded all the backing vocals meaning you can now hear Helen, Jasper and DJ Munch clearly now</li><li>Happy Birthday (Spanish) was rerecorded with the US voice actors.</li><li>Song of Summer (Concert Remix) has Jessi sing Bella's lines and also ends the song after they all sing 'Sing a song of summer with me' to fade into them saying their goodbyes.</li></ul>
