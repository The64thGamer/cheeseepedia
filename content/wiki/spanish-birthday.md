***Spanish Birthday*** was created in 1994 for the opening of {{< wiki-link "Cantagallo / Lo Barnechea, Chile" >}}. It is a Spanish version of 'It's Somebody's Birthday Today' which was originally included in {{< wiki-link "Madame Oink III - 'Tunnel of Love' Spanish Version" >}}. The video footage is taken from early 90s shows. This show ran through August 2002.


## Summary
The show begins with the cast singing and Madame Oink asking Chuck E. who's birthday it is. Chuck E. then says that Jasper told him somebody was having a birthday and it was the 'first time all week he got anything right'. He then instructs everybody to sing 'Happy Birthday to You'. At the end of the song, Chuck E. says Happy Birthday. The video footage during the song is a combination of the footage from Chuck E. March, SPP Concept Unification Premiere, various 1991 Training videos and character art from Twist and Shout.

## Live Show Trivia:
1. Due to this show being reused from a PTT showtape, Madame Oink is featured instead of Helen Henny.
2. This showtape was programmed for {{< wiki-link "Cantagallo / Lo Barnechea, Chile" >}} and later on {{< wiki-link "Guatemala City, Guatemala (Ave La Reforma 7-62, Zona 9)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Mall Plaza Vespucio, Chile" >}}. It's currently unknown if any Unitied States or Canada Munch's Make Believe Band locations ever recieved this live show. 
3. Studio C would recieve Spanish Birthday from its creation until {{< wiki-link "September 2001 Show" >}} when it would be replaced by {{< wiki-link "Spanish Birthday 2001" >}}
4. Spanish Birthday would mistakenly be put on {{< wiki-link "Summer 2002 Show" >}} instead of {{< wiki-link "Spanish Birthday 2001" >}}
