**Sports Trading Cards** was a prototype art piece created for few locations in 1992.
This art was only known to be seen at a select few locations from 1992 to 1993 as it was a prototype piece that never made it into mass production.
After 2010 every location to have had the piece has been removed, leaving SPT with the only one in existence. It is unknown if the art made it out of the office past 2015.
