#### The Talking Machine

This game would allow users to type in any word they wanted for the game to speak back to them. A filter list was created to prevent users from putting swear words into the prompt, reportedly either notifying 'I can't say that' or 'Billy Bob can't say that'.<sup>(0)(1)</sup>

### Technical

The Fun Fair was a modified Apple II computer fit inside a large cabinet with a custom keyboard. The game software was loaded on two 5-1/4' floppy drives.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156031959290554&id=242019870553&set=a.307884760553&mibextid=xfxF2i&rdid=J4jHaQlvhYAnSQfe&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F8kbdKNDoaTU9RjzF%2F%3Fmibextid%3DxfxF2i Its voice capability was likely through the [Echo II Voice Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_II_(expansion_card)).<sup>(0)</sup>
It is noted that the filter list for the Talking Machine game was updated multiple times as users found ways to get around the filter, meaning the software has multiple versions out there.<sup>(0)</sup>
