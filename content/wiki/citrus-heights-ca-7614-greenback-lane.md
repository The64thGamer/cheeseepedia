***Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)*** was the eighth Pizza Time Theatre that opened in Greenback Plaza on December 26th, 1979, and lasted until late 1984.

## History

### Pre-Opening

On November 4th, 1979, a building permit for the location would be published, though oddly at the address of 7620 Greenback Lane instead of the opened 7614.{{< cite 1 >}} On December 23rd it would be announced the opening was set for December 26th, just under a week after the opening of {{< wiki-link "Sparks, NV (530 Greenbrae Dr)" >}}. It would note the location would have Dolli Dimples, 65 games, and a 350 seat capacity. {{< cite 2 >}}

### Opening
The location would open on December 26th, 1979. Two days later it would begin putting out coupons for its opening month.{{< cite 3 >}}

### 1980's
On February 24th, 1980, the location would participate with the {{< wiki-link "Sacramento (Florin Mall), CA (7020 Stockton Blvd)" >}} store on the "Say 'Cheese' with Chuck E.!" promotion. Customers with any purchase could get a free color photo with the Chuck E. Cheese walkaround, alongside a part in a drawing to win a Polaroid One-Step camera. The giveaway would happen between then and the 28th.{{< cite 4 >}}{{< cite 5 >}}

On October 6th, 1980, the store would be part of a company-wide Skee-Ball tournament lasting to the 16th that would raise funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Each child 12 years or younger that participated would have PTT donate 5 cents for every 50-point ticket redeemed for charity. Three age groups would compete in the tournament. The plays were free and kids were offered one play for practice, and the best score from their next two plays  would enter them in the competition. Kids would fill out an entry card with their score and recieve a certificate stating "I Rolled for Multiple Sclerosis" with the amount PTT donated in the kid's name. The top winner in each category would recieve a certificate for merchandise from Jasper's General Store. Top store winners would be notified by mail and posted in the locations. The child with the highest score out of all stores would be declared "Roll for MS National Skee-Ball Tournament Winner".

### Closure
The location would close some time in late 1984, with its last direct mention outside of auctions being on June 13th.{{< cite 21 >}}It would later be noted the store had 80 arcade games by its closure.{{< cite 19 >}}
