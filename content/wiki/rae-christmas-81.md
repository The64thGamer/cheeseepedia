**RAE Christmas '81** is a Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations in November 1981.

## Billy Bob Plush Intro:

Before both Catch a Wave & Unchained Medley. Rolfe & Earl would discuss the brand new Billy Bob plush. The Intro before
Unchained Medley has Earl telling the audience they have a 'very special announcement' which is then forgotten and would
then be announced in 'the next show'<sup>(1)</sup>. The intro before Catch a Wave then goes into how they have 'Billy
Bob Dolls for sale up in the gift shop' then at the very end Earl says 'Can you get me one for Christmas'.<sup>(2)</sup>
