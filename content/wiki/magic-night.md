***Magic Night* is a Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations in February 1984.**

## Revised Version

A tape variant labeled ***Magic Night (Revised)* was released to cut out the dated sections of Segment 8. This
cut out the entirety of the intro, and reduced the *Michael Jackson Melody* to just the song *Beat
It*.<sup>(1)</sup>**

## Part 1-3 Version

Reels have been found by James Marous that are labeled ***Magic Night Part 1, Magic Night Part 2,* and
***Magic Night Part 3.* No other information is known about these tapes. The tapes from his collection were
later damaged and are likely unrecoverable.****
