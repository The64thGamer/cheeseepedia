<b><i>Chuck E. Parade</b></i> is an unreleased live show originally meant to be paired with {{< wiki-link "SPP Concept Unification Premiere" >}} .
This live show was never programmed and Showbiz Pizza Time decided to create and use {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Live 90" >}} instead.
<h2> Summary </h2>
We start with Mr. Munch telling the audience that Chuck E. Cheese will be preforming soon! Then Jasper makes a joke about why they don't get down and perform with the kids in which Helen says its easier to see up there. Pasqually then reminds the audience that Chuck E. Cheese will be out very soon. They then sing a parody of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory"> 'Pure Imagination' (From 'Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory' Soundtrack)</a>. After this Chuck appears and starts singing and performing to a parody of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey,_Look_Me_Over_(song)"> Hey Look Me Over</a>. During this parody Munch's Make Believe Band sing about the many wonderful ways your 'Pure Imagination' can be used.
They then wonder where they should go first with their imagination ending with a jungle. They then arrive in the jungle and begin exploring whilst singing a song about exploring and looking for animals on their 'Jungle Parade'. They say the only way to be safe in the jungle is to 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' They then pretended their elephant trunks then saying 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' They then act like Monkey's swinging from a vine Look high, look low again. They then hear frogs and eventually get through the swamp. Eventually they go into a cave where a lion is found after that they run out of the cave while again singing the song they started with but fast then sing the 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' again.
Finally after this they then sing a modified version <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Hop"> Danny and the Juniors- At The Hop</a>. After this the show is over with Chuck & Munch's Make Believe Band give their goodbyes with the instrumental of the CEC version of 'Pure Imagination' slowly fading out. with the short wink sound effect ending it.
<h2>Live Show Trivia:</h2><ul><li>While its unknown why it was never used most likely it wasn't used due to failing to tell the audience who these characters are to new audience that will see the show as this would play at CU Stores. Along with that this show is very complicated and hard to keep up with compared to Chuck E. Cheese's Live 90 which has more well known songs people can easily dance to whilst also introducing the band in at least name form.</li><li>'Chuck E. Parade' never had footage created for it or had programming done for 3stages / Cyberamics.</li><li></li></ol>
