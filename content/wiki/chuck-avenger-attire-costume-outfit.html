Cheese walkaround received the iconic look as seen on commercials since 1997, the “Avenger outfit” (as referred to in the fall 2004 walkaround care manual) became the standard outfit for walkaround Chuck’s from here on out. The first version of the Avenger outfit features a few noticeable differences on the shirt such as having mesh fabric on the arm pit area. Compared to later releases of the shirt this version is slimmer. The green shorts have stayed consistent throughout this outfits run with no differences or updates throughout the years.
