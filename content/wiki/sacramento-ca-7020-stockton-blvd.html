<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Opening </h3>
The first mention of the Florin store would be on July 28th, 1979 for a job listing for the opening staff.<sup>(4)</sup> The store would open on August 14, 1979.<sup>(0)</sup>
Some time before December of 1979, Florin Center would change its name to the now Florin Mall. The store would celebrate by displaying a PTT themed taxi in the mall itself, alongside hosting a draw for a $1,000 'Dolli Dimples Party'. Bernice Hing would win the draw and bring in 105 guests for the party.<sup>(1)</sup>
Florin's Assistant Manager Ben Kline would be one of the first to complete Pizza Time Theatre's Management Training Program.<sup>(6)</sup> Another Assistant Manager, Randy Morse, would later become one of the training staff for the program in 1981.
During the opening of {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)" >}} on December 26, 1979, the District Manager Roger Berke had to deliver pizzas from the Florin location to Cirtus Heights due to the store's gas lines not being turned on yet.<sup>(2)</sup>
<h3> 1980 </h3>
Some time before May of 1980, Scott Nelson, a former assistant manager for {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}} during its opening, would be named manager of the Florin Mall location. He would be Pizza Time Theatre's youngest manager at the time- being just 21.<sup>(8)</sup>
<h3> 1983 </h3>
In early 1983 Florin would receive the award for best performance in the Northern California area for training employees for 1982.<sup>(9)</sup> At the same time Florin alongside Sacramento, CA (7020 Stockton Blvd), Lodi, CA, {{< wiki-link "Modesto, CA (3037 Sisk Rd)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Sacramento, CA (1690-96 Arden Way)" >}} would host a dough rolling tournament. It is unknown which store won.
<h3> Closing </h3>
The store would be held for auction on December 14, 1985 at 10AM. It is unknown if the store had already closed before then.<sup>(1)</sup>
