<b><i>Mumbai, India</b> (<b>R City Mall, 1st Floor, Lal Bahadur Shastri Rd, next to Pantaloons (R City Mall, Mumbai, Maharastra))</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on December 20, 2019, with a Dance Floor, and closed on July 25th, 2023.<sup>(1)</sup> On Instagram, DMs have suggested that there have been plans to relocate Chuck E. Cheese to another store.
This location was the very first location in the country of India and was also the last store to open in 2019, and the 2010's decade.
<h2>History</h2>
Chuck E. Cheese's first Indian location opened on December 20, 2019, at R City Mall in Ghatkopar (West), Mumbai. Situated on the first floor of the mall next to Pantaloons, this venue represented the brand's first franchise in the Indian market.
The Mumbai location featured the signature combination of food, arcade games, and entertainment.
<p>In terms of the food that was served, the menu featured special regional toppings for the pizzas such as paneer, chicken tikka and tandoori. They also catered a "Veg/Jain" menu for the vegetarians who primarily belonged to Jainism, Buddhism or a few Hindus who followed strict dietary restrictions.</p>
<p>Following the 2019 design model, the venue included the interactive dance floor, however the store did not feature a video wall. In terms of the walkarounds, they received all 5 of the rockstar walkarounds which were brought out most of the time regardless of whether there was a live show or not.<sup>
<p>The Indian franchise rights for Chuck E. Cheese were held by Nextrel Ventures LLP, which positioned itself as a company setting up "World class operations in Food, Entertainment & Retail in India". As the official franchisee, Nextrel was responsible for bringing the American entertainment concept to the Indian market and adapting it to the local preferences while maintaining the core brand experience.</p>
<p>Despite the initial enthusiasm and continued attraction, the Mumbai Chuck E. Cheese location  closed on July 25, 2023, after operating for approximately three and a half years. Following the closure, there were indications on social media platforms, particularly Instagram, suggesting potential plans to relocate the Chuck E. Cheese operation to another location within Mumbai or anywhere else in India. However, as of March 2025, no official announcements have been made regarding a reopening or new location in Mumbai or elsewhere in India.</p>
