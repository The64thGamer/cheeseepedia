Star Cap Thumb Logo was exterior signage produced for ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc from 1995 to 2001. Giving a thumbs up, Chuck E. wears a yellow sweater with green accents and a red baseball cap with a green interior and a yellow star on the crown. The word mark is red that subtly fades into orange.

## Usage

The first usage of this signage is unknown. It was used for locations with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} and early {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} remodel programs as well as some stores with the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program. In 1998, the star on Chuck E.'s cap was replaced with a yellow 'C'. When {{< wiki-link "La Mesa, CA (5500 Grossmont Center Dr)" >}} closed in December 29, 2024, {{< wiki-link "Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave)" >}} became the final Star Cap location. The sign went extinct when it was removed from Willowdale on June 6th, 2025.
