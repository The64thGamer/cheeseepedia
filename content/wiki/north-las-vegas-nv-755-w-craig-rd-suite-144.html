<b><i>755 W. Craig Rd Suite 144, Store #208</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> located in North Las Vegas inside the Revere Marketplace that opened on January 19th, 2024, and is open to this day.
This is not to be confused with the {{< wiki-link "North Las Vegas, NV (2520 E Lake Mead Blvd)" >}} Pizza Time Theatre that opened in October 1982 and closed sometime in 1984 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} as it was 17 minutes away.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Pre-CEC </h3>
Before the store's opening it originally opened as a Big Lots, which closed in 2020 presumably due to relocation.<sup>(1)</sup> Plans about the store's construction appeared as early as April 2023, with construction beginning in September 2023.
<h3> Opening </h3>
On January 19th, 2024, the store would have a soft opening, later hosting a Grand Reopening celebration on January 31st. The store also installed a special fixture on the exterior of the building, promoting the store's Trampoline Zone.
