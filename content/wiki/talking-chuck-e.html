<b><i>Talking Chuck E.</b></i> was a singular prototype toy created in 1997 by <i>Streets Player Holdings Corporation</i>.
The plush was able to play music by squeezing its right hand. Powering the unit required 3 'AA' batteries which were included with the box.
<h2> Condition </h2>
The current only known prototype unit has its battery compartment shattered. Due to this, it is unknown what audio the plush would play when powered on.
