<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Location as a Pizza Time Theatre / Chuck E. Cheese's </h3>
The Pizza Time Theatre in Chico California on 966 East Avenue opened in July 1982. The locationed would get the {{- wiki-link "SPT 1992 Remodel Program" -}} in 1993, which added the CEC Pizza logo & New store Decor. The location would gain a {{- wiki-link "2-Stage" -}} in 1993 as well.
<h3> Fun Zone & Pizza </h3>
Fun Zone & Pizza was created after Chico Lost it's license to the CEC IP. The location would retrofit its animatronics & replace old CEC Decor with new ones (with some allegedly hidden from public view). The company used a dog, cow, & lion as the mascot costumes placed over the bots. The Location would use dollar store items & frozen pizza instead of corporate items. The wall decor also became generic mascot ones though they kept the salad bar sign.
The only location of Fun Zone & Pizza would be Chico, CA as it would close in late 2011 due to unprofitability.
