**Sensory Sensitive Sundays (SSS)** is a program used at Chuck E. Cheese restaurants, used to encourage families with children on the austism spectrum. The program started in 2016, in which every sunday in the month of April, participating CEC stores open an hour or two early to let families with autistic children experience CEC without the overly stimulating atmosphere of a normal visit.

## History

In 2016, CEC Entertainment, Inc. partnered with Autism Speaks, which is a controversial non-profit autism awareness organization, to create a program for families with children who are on the autism spectrum.

## Controversy

While the CEC program has not received any controversy, the partner organization of the program, Autism Speaks, has received a large widespread controversy regarding it's statements on autism. Autism Speaks has regarded autism as a disease, and not a disorder, and formerly stated in their mission statement that they were looking to find a supposed 'cure' for autism, although they removed any reference to said statement of a cure in 2016.
