<h2> History </h2>
Bel-Air opened on March 29, 1993 with a 1-Stage and the 1993 update to the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}. Bel-Air was the second 1-Stage in Maryland after the first 1-Stage in existence was installed at the {{< wiki-link "Waldorf, MD (2928 Festival Way)" >}} store the year prior, Bel-Air was also one of the earliest 1-Stages installed in March 1993 with 2-Stage backdrops along with Lakeland, FL. Bel-Air had the food, family, fun thumb chuck logo that was used in few locations like {{< wiki-link "Akron, OH (2779 West Market St)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Melrose Park, IL (1315 W North Ave)" >}} up until their 2.0 remodel in 2019.
Bel-Air received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2005 Remodel Program" >}} remodel</a> in the late 2000's and kept their 1-Stage and unique building logo. Around this time, the cyberamic Chuck replaced its tuxedo that it wore since opening with the newer avenger shirt and shorts keeping the red cool chuck cap until about 2011. The store remained in the same physical condition with minor cosmetic changes (mainly Chuck's cap removal in 2013) until 2019 when the store received one of the early 2.0 remodels. Bel-Air was the second store in Maryland to receive 2.0 after {{< wiki-link "Glen Burnie, MD (6637 Governor Ritchie Hwy)" >}} the year prior.
