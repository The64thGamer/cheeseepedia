The ***Bowling Digest* ***(Magazine)* was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.****

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue- Bowling (Shelf Item) which has Chuck E. wearing a Bowling uniform while holding a bowling ball and alongside a set of miniature bowling pins.
