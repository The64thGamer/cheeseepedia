The ***SPP Curtain Cont Bypass Board* is a board used in an unknown amount of Gray Box|Gray Boxes.
The only confirmed sightings of the board would be at {{< wiki-link "Fargo, ND (1202 Nodak Dr)" >}} and in a Gray Box eBay listing.**

## Function

This board was used to keep curtains open if the main curtain controller stopped working. The board itself was a cheap prototyping board from *Radio Shack*, though is still believed to have been sent out by CEC Corporate at the time. Its currently unclear if more existed.
The text printed on the labels and written on the board itself reads:

> SPP CURTAIN CONT BYPASS
> 006-0052-90
> use only If Main C.C.P. go s Down
> THIS SIDE UP
