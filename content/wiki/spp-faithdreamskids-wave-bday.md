## Trivia:

- The same intermission music & videos would be used in the {{< wiki-link "SPP Rolfe & Earl" >}} except for Gigi On The Beach 'Please Please Me' which would have
  been replaced with the Rolfe & Earl Birthday skit for the potential birthday parties while construction was
  happening with the other two stages. CEC Neighbors / Dreams can also be considered to use the same intermission
  music & videos as it was released around the same time frame.
- This show recycles two segments from it's previous showtape {{< wiki-link "SPP Kids - Tune Machine" >}} that was released earlier this year.
