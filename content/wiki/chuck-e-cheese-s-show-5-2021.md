## Trivia

- Chuck E. & Friends - "The Holiday Party" was written by Eric Neal as a request from Matt Daniel. Neal, enjoying old school hip-hop, created the song in a similar vein to ['So What'Cha Want'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_What%27cha_Want) by the Beastie Boys.
- Munch & Munch - "The Windowsill" was also written by Matt Daniel as a new Munch song. The song was a nod to [Baby It's Cold Outside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby,_It%27s_Cold_Outside). Matt Daniel's idea for the song was for Munch to struggle with his conscience in song, an idea that he had been considering for several years. A member of the entertainment department eventually came up with theming the song around the holidays, and with a new Munch puppet being created around the same time, Matt went ahead with the creation of the song.
- On the DVD Menu for the Munch's Make Believe Band set up, it reads 'Show 5, 2020' instead of 'Show 5, 2021'.
- Hidden at the end of the Studio C SD copy of Show 5, 2021 is a slowed down and reversed clip of 'Merry Christmastime'. The purpose of the clip is in regards to Timecodes; this is done so that each show's total length will be the same.
- The I-Drive (7419 International Dr, Orlando, FL) store played the show four days early for its 2.0 remodel opening.
