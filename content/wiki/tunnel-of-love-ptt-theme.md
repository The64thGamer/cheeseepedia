The ***Pizza Time Theatre Tunnel of Love Theme* was a temporary alteration to the stage and character designs for use in the 1982 Madame Oink III - Tunnel of Love showtape.**

## Stage Design

The backdrop behind the characters would read 'TUNNEL of LOVE', and a heart reading 'EXIT' would be placed behind Madame Oink. The characters would go virtually unchanged during the alteration.
