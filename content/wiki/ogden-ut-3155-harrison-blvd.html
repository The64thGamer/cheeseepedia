<b><i>Ogden UT (3155 Harrison Blvd)</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> located in Ogden, Utah.
The location opened on May 17th, 1980 in the Harrison Plaza and was apart of a franchise by Rocky Mountain Development Corp., headed by Larry Rose.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2>Stages</h2>
Ogden, Utah would open with a portrait show with Cyberamics, starring Foxy Colleen and the May 1980 Showtape 'Showboat'.<sup>(1)</sup> The show would continue on as normal, getting regular guest stars like Madame Oink and Harmony Howlette. Sometime in between the guest star rotation, the nametags for the characters were replaced with the balcony nametags that were standard at the time. In 1984, the guest star role would be replaced with the addition of Broadway Helen Henny. In 1987, the show would be shut off for unknown reasons<sup>(3)</sup>.
<h3> Cabaret Act </h3>
When Ogden opened, the Cabaret act was housed by 2nd gen Dolli Dimples. Sometime near 1987, the Cabaret act would be filled by King. The wareabouts of other Cabaret acts are unknown. Sometime around 1987, the King would be replaced with a standalone TV until Ogden's closure.
<h2>History</h2>
Prior to Ogden's opening, a franchise agreement was settled by Rocky Mountain Development Corp. and Pizza Time Theatre, Inc. to open a store in a 8000 square feet section of Harrison Plaza. Contractor Joseph Bauman worked with plans made by architect Ronald D. Hales, AIA, of Ogden to concept the store. When Ogden opened, it could seat 3,230 guests throughout the entire facility. The Pizza Time Theatre would premiere with Foxy Colleen's 'Showboat' showtape and Dolli Dimple's current showtape at the time.<sup>(1)</sup>
In 1987, the store began to cheap out on some aspects. All shows were turned off and the King was replaced with a television monitor. Arcade Machines were breaking down and lighting fixtures burned out/
Sometime near the closure, Ogden slowly started to receive the '88 Remodel Package and got various movie parody posters.
Following Ogden's closure, the spot would be rebranded as 'Carnival Pizza', which closed sometime in the 90s. Sometime around the late 2000's, the entire plaza would undergo a huge renovation effort, including putting a new side entrance on the front of the building to the vacant spot. All of the animatronics were sent to Banjo Billyâ€™s Pizza and remained there until closing in 1997.
<h3> Paris Cafe </h3>
In 2012, a live performance based cafe named 'Paris Cafe' would open in the former PTT spot and would notably publish tons of photos on it's Facebook page, revealing that a majority of the PTT's old layout had gone completely untouched since it's closure and that many old arcade machines from around the PTT era was still there, 20+ years after its closure. Around 2013, the cafe began to struggled as live performers weren't prevalent. Around 2014, the cafe closed permanently.<sup>(5)</sup>
