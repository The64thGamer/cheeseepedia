- During Act 3 when scenes feature Chuck E. Cheese you can see the Pizza Time Theater logo on his shirt.
- Mike Wolf & Corby were originally seen during September 2014 during flash back with Justin Beaver.
- This show was originally planned to include six songs like most shows since April 2013, the latter two would've been covers. However, following the entertainment department's budget cut after the cat video lawsuit they were removed leaving the show with only four songs. This would've included Helen singing a new version of 'Crazy' from January 2008 and the other cover currently unknown.
