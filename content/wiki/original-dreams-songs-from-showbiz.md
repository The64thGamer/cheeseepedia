***Original Dreams: Songs From Showbiz*** is a compilation album of original songs by The Rock-afire Explosion released on April 12, 2025.

## History

Justin Ishmael, designer of the [Billy Bob Brockali Vinyl Figure](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/vinyl-7-billy-bob-figure/) for Creative Engineering in 2018, would also partner during the development of the figure to make a new album for the Rock-afire Explosion. This would be teased in May of 2017 by Aaron Fechter, claiming the song "Too Shy" would appear on the album. Zero mentions of the album or its whereabouts would occur over the next eight years until its reveal on February 6, 2025, set for a launch on April 12 of the same year. The album would release as a Record Store Day exclusive album.
The album features original songs written by various members of [The Tropical Cleaners](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/tropical-cleaners/) and Jeff Howell's former band Clutch, framed as songs by The Rock-afire Explosion. A few post-millennium songs would also be included, such as "Sittin' Too Long," "Kerry's Waltz," and "It's Time To Go."

## Releases

### Yellow Vinyl

The yellow vinyl edition of the album was the first to be commercially available on April 12 (Record Store Day,) 2025. Only 1,200 copies were pressed to be sold. The album's cover features photography and easter eggs from the ShowBiz era, alongside cover art that can be swapped out to present multiple different characters. Additionally, the vinyl versions of the album contain an exclusive easter egg where after "It's Time To Go" finishes a locked groove will play Antioch's voice on loop.

### Splatter Vinyl

The splatter vinyl edition of the album was pressed exclusively for Terror Vision's record club, with only 100 copies produced, each one being hand numbered. It features album artwork identical to that of the yellow vinyl edition. Aaron Fechter would later sell multiple copies of this version of the album via his eBay account, each autographed in two places, both by himself and an unspecified musician/voice actor featured on the album (likely Rick Bailey.) Along with it also came a two hour tour of the Creative Engineering Museum.

### CD

The CD would become available for purchase on Terror Vision's website after Record Store Day ended on April 13, 2025. Only 500 units were produced. The front and back cover of the album remain unchanged on the CD release, however the interior features significantly less artwork than the vinyl releases. The disc itself has an image of The Rock-afire Explosion in the studio, originally taken for *Gee, Our 1st Album!*, and the band's logo in the compartment behind it.

### Cassette

The cassette would become available at the same time as the CD on Terror Vision's website. The fewest units of this version of the album were produced, being only 200. The front and back cover are also completely different from all other releases, better suited for the narrower artwork specifications. The front cover is similar, but features an image of Billy Bob alone, and the back is much more simplified. The interior is also completely different, featuring the image previously shown on the standard cover for the album. The cassette tape itself is orange with the band's name on it.
