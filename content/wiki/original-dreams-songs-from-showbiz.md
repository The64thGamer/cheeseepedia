***Original Dreams: Songs from Showbiz*** is a compilation album of original songs by The Rock-afire Explosion released on April 12, 2025.

## History

Justin Ishmael, designer of the [Billy Bob Brockali Vinyl Figure](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/vinyl-7-billy-bob-figure/) for Creative Engineering in 2018, would also partner during the development of the figure to make a new album for the Rock-afire Explosion. This would be teased in May of 2017 by Aaron Fechter, claiming the song "Too Shy" would appear on the album. Zero mentions of the album or its whereabouts would occur over the next eight years until its reveal on February 6, 2025, set for a launch on April 12 of the same year. The album would release as a "Record Store Day" exclusive album.
The album features original songs written by various members of [The Tropical Cleaners](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/tropical-cleaners/) and Jeff Howell's former band Clutch, framed as songs by The Rock-afire Explosion. A few post-millennium songs would also be included, such as "Sittin' Too Long," "Kerry's Waltz," and "It's Time To Go."


The songs would be taken from the highest quality source available, something Aaron Fechter had already been working on since moving all Creative Engineering assets to the new Creative Engineering building. The album's artwork features photography and easter eggs from the ShowBiz era, alongside cover art that can be swapped out to present multiple different characters. The album was additionally released on CD and cassette tape through Terror Vision's website on April 13. Quantities were limited to 500 units for CD and 200 for cassette.
