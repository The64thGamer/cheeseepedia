Original Dreams: Songs from ShowBiz is a Rock-afire Explosion album released on April 12th, 2025.

## History

Justin Ishmael, producer of the Vinyl 7' Billy Bob Figure for Creative Engineering in 2019, would also partner during the development of the figure in 2017 to make an album for the Rock-afire Explosion. This would be teased in May of 2017 by Aaron, claiming the song "Too Shy" would appear on the album (Which it later did).
Zero mentions of the album or its whereabouts would occur over the next 8 years until its reveal on February 6th, 2025 set for an April 12th launch. The album would be set to release on 'Record Store Day' as an exclusive album.
The album would feature songs from when the Rock-afire played in ShowBiz Pizza, rather than their later 90's Family Entertainment Center offerings and post-millennium internet songs aside from 'It's Time To Go' from 2017. The songs would ripped from their highest quality source, something Aaron Fechter had already been working on since moving all Creative Engineering assets to the Creative Engineering Workshop. The album's art would be set to feature photography and easter eggs from the ShowBiz era, alongside cover art that can be swapped out to present multiple different characters.
The album was additionally released on CD and cassette through Terror Vision's website on April 13th. Quantities were limited to 500 units for the CD and 200 for the cassette. Casette orders would later arrive in late May.
