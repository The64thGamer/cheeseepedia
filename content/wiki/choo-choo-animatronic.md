***Choo Choo*** (Also Munch Jr.) was an animatronic prop figure featured on the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}. It is a simple figure, as its only movement is raising up from his tree stump. On early versions of the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}, he would also have a spotlight.

## History

Choo Choo featured in Rock-afire Explosion shows first debuting in 1980 at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} on August 14th of that year. Choo Choo would later be converted to Munch Jr. during {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, now resembling a smaller Mr. Munch with a propeller cap. Munch Jr. would additionally gain a spotlight used from the original {{< wiki-link "Antioch (Animatronic)" >}} spotlight. He would later lose his spotlight with the {{< wiki-link "September '94" >}} showtape, as stores were instructed to switch the spotlight out with a gobo light that faced the center stage curtains. The last official Munch Jr. in a store was at the Wilmington, North Carolina location, which would close in October of 2020.
