The ***Showdog* is a cancelled {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} menu item from 1985.
The item would have a trademark filing on July 23, 1985, featuring a stippled logo displaying 'SHOWDOG'. The listing describes it as a hot dog that would come with potato chips and a soft drink. Also in 1985, the {{< wiki-link "Torpedo Dog (SPP Menu Item)" >}} would release. It is possible the Showdog would be an unused name for the Torpedo Dog, but it is unconfirmed.<sup>(0)</sup>**
