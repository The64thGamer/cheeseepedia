***Showboat*** is a lost {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre">}} showtape released as the first {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}} tape in the week of April 21st-27th, 1980.

## History

The show played exclusively at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} location for its Cyberamics debut, featuring Foxy Colleen. The new show would be promoted and advertised featuring "new light works", likely referring to either the strip of bulbs above the characters, or the additional colored spotlights of the Cyberamics Balcony Stage compared to Kooser's previous stage.
Within the first few weeks of the show and stage's debut, *Kehr Research* would conduct an independent store survey for people's reactions, which would determine if the Balcony concept would continue for future stores. This would succeed and the plans would continue to other stores. It is unknown if the tape played outside of the Kooser location during its run.
