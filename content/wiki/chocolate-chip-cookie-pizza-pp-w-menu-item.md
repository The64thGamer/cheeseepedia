The ***Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza*** was a {{< wiki-link "Pasqually's Pizza & Wings" >}} menu item introduced in 2020.
As its name suggests, it consists of a large chocolate chip cookie split into 8 slices like a pizza (described as "sharable" on the official menu). Each slice was said to have 53 calories.<sup>(1)</sup>

## History

The Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza was an early item on the restaurant's menu and the only dessert they offered at the time. The exact date it first became available is currently unknown, but it was no earlier than May 19, 2020 (the date {{< wiki-link "Pasqually's Pizza Website" "the restaurant's website" >}} was first archived by the Wayback Machine).<sup>(1)</sup> This was close to two months after Pasqually's first began operating in late March.<sup>(2)</sup>
The item was removed from sale on July 8, 2020, corresponding with a complete overhaul of the menu. The {{< wiki-link "Iced Brownie (PP&W Menu Item)" "Iced Brownie" >}} took its place as Pasqually's sole dessert option.<sup>(2)</sup> While the earliest Wayback Machine archive of the new menu dates to July 31, the file name of the menu image on the site further indicates this change was made on the 8th of the month.<sup>(3)</sup>
