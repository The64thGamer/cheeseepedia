Buddy Crash was created for the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}} which would be sold to Morey's Piers and Americana Amusement Park. His mask mold was later reused for the {{< wiki-link "The Wolfman (Animatronic)" >}} in the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} and Colonel Stonewall J. Fox in the {{< wiki-link "Confederate Critter Show" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
Buddy Crash along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<sup>(1)</sup> and currently resides at the CEI museum.
<h2> Design </h2>
In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a top hat, collar, black bowtie, and striped vest. At Morey's Piers he wore a straw hat, red bandana, and overalls. He plays the drums with the '4 Seasoned Bears' logo on the front.
<h2> Movements </h2>
Due to lack of footage or photos of internals, movements can only be inferred. All that is known is that he along with the rest of the bots in the show had very limited movement.<ul><li>Mouth</li><li>Left eyelid</li><li>Right eyelid</li><li>Head left</li><li>Head right</li><li>Head up</li><li>Left elbow</li><li>Right elbow</li></ul>
