The **Bicycling (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Bicycling (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese wearing a black hat with a green shirt and brown pants. In the background of the Chuck Statue is his bicycle.
