The ***Retro Chuck E. Cheese (186) Funko POP!* is a ***POP! Ad Icons* Funko POP! featuring Chuck E. Cheese in his Avenger style and attire, released on June 6, 2023.****

## Production

Watermarked renders of the figure would be leaked by *popnewws_* on Instagram on April 25, 2023<sup>(1)</sup>, ahead of the official unveiling. Later that day *dis.trackers* on Instagram would leak the full renders in high resolution after acquiring it from *popnewws_*.<sup>(2)</sup>
Preorders would then appear on Hot Topic<sup>(3)</sup>, Amazon<sup>(4)</sup>, and Entertainment Earth<sup>(5)(6)</sup>, confirming the release window and price. Hot Topic would get the earliest release date with June 6, 2023, while Amazon would be marked for July 12th. Entertainment Earth would just list their release as 'July'.
The item would stop being sold on the Funko website sometime in late 2023 to early 2024. The earliest archive of the sold-out notice would be on May 13th, 2024.<sup>(7)</sup>

## Design

The design features Avenger Chuck E. Cheese in his complete outfit, shaped in the Funko POP! style. Chuck E. is in a neutral standing pose, with his right arm outstretched to the side, and his left arm holding a Type 4 design token, which began production in 1995 with the CEC Token 401 (B, C, N). The token is modified to have its date at the bottom blanked out and replaced with another stamped dot. Chuck E.'s cap is also facing forward instead of flipped around, a trait generally only shared with the {{< wiki-link "Chuck 2005 (Costume Head)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Chuck 2010 (Costume Head)" >}}.
