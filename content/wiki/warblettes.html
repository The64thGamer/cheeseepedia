The Warblettes are a trio of background singers represented by three animated crows (or magpies): Daisy, Maisy, and Irma. They sway side to side while singing and moving their beaks, sometimes announcing upcoming shows. Adorned with jewelry, they add a charming touch to performances.

They first appeared at the very first Pizza Time Theater in San Jose, California, positioned on a red stage above the dining area. Initially, their movements were limited to beak motions. However, they were temporarily replaced by The Mopsey Sisters during a redesign. When the Warblettes returned, they had been updated with closer spacing, differently shaped beaks, larger eyes, and the ability to rock side to side.

In 1980, they became an official part of the balcony stage. Then, in 1983, they underwent another transformation, sporting white fur, bright dresses, and rainbow-colored hair—giving them a more vibrant appearance. This colorful version of the Warblettes is rare, with only a few known to exist.

By the late 1980s, with the introduction of the Rocker Stage and C-Stage, the Warblettes were permanently replaced by Singing Flowers.

Fortunately, models of the Warblettes have been preserved at Jungle Jim’s (Eastgate, Ohio), where they are referred to as "Jungle Pets" and are well cared for. Their colorful variant can also be found at Smitty’s Super Service Station and is displayed at the American Treasure Tour Museum in Oaks, Pennsylvania. Both versions—the original crow design and the colorful variation—can be seen at Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum. It’s been quite the journey for these feathered performers!
