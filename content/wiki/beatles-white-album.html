<i>Beatles White Album</i> is a Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations on September 9 -
November 24, 1983.
Due to the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival" >}}
event, the showtape was only played every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of its run.

<h2> Employee Performance </h2>
The 'Tribute to Frank Sinatra' segment would need to be performed with an employee, whom would come out as 'Johnny
DeJockimo' (official spelling unknown) to interact with Rolfe & Earl. <ref name=':0'>
    https://www.showbizpizza.com/review/rae/1983_beatleswhite.html</ref>
This is directly tied to the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival" >}} reusing the {{< wiki-link "3 Birthday Shows - Colander History - Indoctrination Skit" "Colander History / Indoctrination Skit" >}} on Wednesday nights, which also has the same employee
performance dynamic.

<h2> Production </h2>
<h3> Small Appliances / End of the World </h3>
The showtape was originally going to contain the skit and song 'Small Appliances / End of the World'. The skit would
feature Rolfe creating a counter movement to the {{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)" "Colander-head Club" >}} where customers would come in with 'Small appliances strapped to their head'. A
similar idea is joked about in the {{< wiki-link "Save The Colander Telethon (1983)" "Save The Colander Telethon" >}} with an employee noting Pizza Time Theatre was going to have patrons strap refrigerators to their
backs, with Burt Wilson replying 'Ah, they're going to get into appliances on their heads, they might get us on that'.
Earl directly mentions the Colander Head night taking place on Wednesday nights. This was because of the return of the
Crazy Colander Head Night during {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival" >}}, where both White Album and the  {{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)" "Crazy Colander Head Night" >}} showtape would be playing in the same weeks for the entirety of their run.
This was originally meant to synergize the two showtapes, which was already being done by the inclusion of employee
performances in 'Tribute to Frank Sinatra'.<sup>(0)</sup>
The segment in the end would be cut, but would still appear exclusively on Rock-afire Explosion Record 10
(1983)|Rock-afire Explosion Record 10, minus the Small Appliances skit.<sup>(0)</sup> Oddly, 2 days before the event was
planned to start, an interview with Aaron Fechter has him directly discussing the Small Appliances segment, implying it
might have been cut very last minute.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h3> White Album Revised & ADAT Edit </h3>
A revised version of the showtape was released going under 'White Album Revised'. The original tape was labeled on August 25, 1983, while the revised would be on September 19th, 1983. It is unclear what changes were made with this edition of the tape. It is actually unknown if the current show list is of the Revised tape, or the original release. It is also unknown if the Small Appliances / End of the World segment ever made it onto either version.
On an ADAT tape of the 'Small Appliances / End of the World' segment in Creative Engineering, the monologue between
Rolfe & Earl about small appliances is cut entirely. Earl saying 'Yeah, you aren't invited' immediately cuts to the 'Ok,
moving right along' line- chopping out about 2 minutes of audio. As of current knowledge this edit was never used in any
showtape, but may have been what was on the revised/original tape.
<h3> ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival </h3>
The tape was exclusively part of {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival" >}} as the 'New Stage Shows' portion of the event. The tape would play every Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday, with {{< wiki-link "Fatz Showtape (Uncle Klunk Install 2 Stg)" "Fatz Showtape" >}}
playing on Mondays, {{< wiki-link "Country Night" "Country Night" >}} playing on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and
{{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night" "Crazy Colander Head Night" >}} playing on Wednesdays.
After this, the store would move onto playing {{< wiki-link "Christmas 1983" "Christmas 1983" >}}, meaning
Beatles White Album never played for a continuous amount of time like all other showtape releases, and was playing
alongside previously released shows.
