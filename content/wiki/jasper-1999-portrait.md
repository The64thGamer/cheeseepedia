**Jasper 1999 Portrait** was a piece of artwork featuring Jasper T. Jowls, and you could find it in Chuck E. Cheese's locations starting in 1999. 

## Production

This portrait came out in 1999 as part of a big character redesign. Lots of other decor items were released at the same time. You'd mainly see this portrait in newer Studio C locations from 1999 into the 2000's, but they also added it to some older stores that got a remodel. The portrait was a big part of the new store look, which was all about making the characters seem more modern and dynamic.

## Design 

The art shows Jasper T. Jowls with his classic long ears and brown fur, wearing a blue t-shirt. In the portrait, his left hand is simply resting near his stomach, the background is a cool mix of turquoise and green, which gives it a really vibrant feel. you can also spot the word "JASPER" in a stylized font at the bottom of the art along with a copyright notice that says "Â© 1999 SHOWBIZ PIZZA TIME, INC." in the bottom left corner 

## Usage 

This portrait was a big part of the decor in lots of Chuck E. Cheese's locations from the late 90s and into the 2000s. You would normally see it hanging next to other portraits in high traffic spots like Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny and Mr. Munch. They usually put these portraits in high traffic spots like dining rooms or near the games, to really show off the updated characters.
