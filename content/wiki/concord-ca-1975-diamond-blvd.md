***Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd, Building D-100)*** was the third *Pizza Time Theatre* location that opened sometime within the week of May 28th - June 3rd of 1979 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Portrait / Shelf Stage" >}} and two floors, which closed in January of 1994 with a unknown stage.{{< cite 4 >}}

## History
Concord's earliest mention would be on December 4th, 1978, stating the planned third location would open in The Willows in March of that year.{{< cite 7 >}} The first look at Concord's Cyberamics would be shown, still in development at the Atari Consumer Division Manufacturing Offices, on January 18th, 1979.{{< cite 8 >}} By February 12th, it would be stated the opening would now be in April of that year.{{< cite 6 >}}

The store would open in the last week of May of 1979 at the *Willows Shopping Center* with its manager being Rob Schmidt.{{< cite 1 >}}{{< cite 11 >}} Its restaurant would be on the first floor, and the Fantasy Forest Game Preserve on the second floor.{{< cite 2 >}}{{< cite 9 >}} It would feature the first ever set of {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}, alongsite a Cyberamic {{< wiki-link "Dolli Dimples (Cabaret)" >}} on the second floor.{{< cite 4 >}}{{< cite 9 >}} It is possible the store opened with a Cyberamic Madame Oink with the debut of the {{< wiki-link "Madame Oink II" >}} showtape, though unconfirmed. Notably the building plans feature a sketch approved on March 8th, 1979, of the main showfloor, which shows a second {{< wiki-link "Applause Board (Cyberamic)" >}}, alongside the Mopsey Sisters and Foxy Colleen. An undated, but early photo does show the Warblettes in the Mopsey Sisters place, and the next Foxy Colleen showtape wouldn't release until 1980. The second Applause Board has not been shown yet.

In early 1980, the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre 1980 Spot (Commercial)" >}} commercial would be filmed at the location. Later into the location's life its Dolli would be replaced by {{< wiki-link "Artie Antlers (Cabaret)" >}} and later {{< wiki-link "B.B. Bubbles (Cabaret)" >}}.{{< cite 4 >}} In May of 1980 the assistant manager of the store, Sheri Walther, would win the *Pizza Times* 'Name this Newsletter' contest alongside two others who suggested the same name, with all three splitting the prize.

The store would appear on KTVU on March 26, 1981.{{< cite 3 >}} In May of 1982 a coloring contest with the Martinez News-Gazette would have its winners displayed in many stores in the area, including the Concord location.{{< cite 10 >}}

In the early 80's an incident would occur at the location where they glass from the salad bar had slide off its frame and shatter, injuring a child with several cuts and a leg gash. The parents sued PTT and won the settlement.{{< cite 4 >}}

The store would close in January of 1994 for unknown reasons, being replaced by a UFC Gym which is still around to present day.{{< cite 4 >}}
