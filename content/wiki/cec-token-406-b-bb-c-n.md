The **CEC Token 406 (B, bB, C, N)** was a token released from 2000 to 2001.

## Design

The token's design is the last one to have the juvenile mouse head. Above the head there is text saying, 'Where a Kid Can Be a Kid'. Underneath the head is the date 2000 with three dots to the left and right of the date.
