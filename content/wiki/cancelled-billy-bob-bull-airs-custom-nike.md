The ***Billy Bob Bull-Airs Custom Nike* was a cancelled product set to launch in 2025 after the Chuck E. Cheese Bull-Airs line.**

## History

Bull-Airs would reveal a Billy Bob SneakerHeadz used for the shoe on January 16th, teasing the potential collaboration. Later on January 20th Bull-Airs claimed they could not acquire the Rock-afire license from Creative Engineering, but did not state the reason why it was declined. Later on images for the shoe would leak online.
The shoes were officially released on July 11th, 2025, albeit branded as Showbiz Pizza to avoid copyright issues.^[1]^
