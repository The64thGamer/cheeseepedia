## History

Phoenix (Bell) was announced in a January 1999 article from BizJournals, which revealed that it was owned by an unknown franchisee in Tucson.{{<cite #1>}} It opened in late March 1999 {{<cite #2>}} with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} (the second in Arizona) {{<cite #3>}}{{<cite #4>}} and the {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} game package. Around 2006/2007, they received part of the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, getting new paint and art, but keeping the store's original layout. It was one of the only Arizona stores with the rare Star Stage posters.{{<cite #3>}} The store would have many job advertisements in *The Arizona Republic* throughout the years, keeping the Cool Chuck logo until its last ad in 2009.{{<cite #4>}} Phoenix (Bell) closed in January 2015. A Dollar Tree opened on the space, which is still there as of 2025. The Studio C Alpha bot was moved to {{< wiki-link "Chandler, AZ (2977 West Frye Rd)" >}}, where it remained until 2023.
