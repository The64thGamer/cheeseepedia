The ***Winchester Warblettes Animatronic*** was a series of small animatronics produced in 1977 and 1978 by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} for the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} location on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}. The bot used the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Hardware Setup" >}} for programming &amp; the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Control System" >}} for controlling the bots movements. The Bot originally used an Unknown design due to the obscurity of the images in which it appears {{<cite 2 >}}. The Second version of the Bot was built around June of 1978 alongside Dolli and the V2 Chuck & Crusty{{< cite 3 >}}.
The Bot's end date is Unknown as it's unclear if the Bot would have been replaced in late 1979 for Cyberamics due It not being the same base as the Cyberamic Warblettes.

## History

### Production &amp; Manufacturing

Before the Bot was created, Harold Goldbrandsen created concept art showing what the bot could do. The concept art had scrapped movements for the eyes, heads, &amp; hands {{< cite 4 >}}. The Bot was developed in early 1977 by Harold Goldbrandsen &amp; Fantasy Forest.

### Location Use

The original Bot was installed in {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} &amp; Programmed to the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Showtape" >}} in Early 1977. The bot was later programmed to the {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny Showtape" >}}, the {{< wiki-link "Madame Oink I" >}}, &amp; the {{< wiki-link "Foxy Colleen I" >}} from August 1978 to November 1978. It's Unknown when in this period of time if any the original Bot was repalced with the Updated Model. The Bot was seen in an episode of the Australian broadcast series, 'Four Corners' in their 'New Eatery Fad' segment {{< cite 1 >}}.

### Fate

The Bot's Removal is Unconfirmed, alongside most of Winchester's later history. It is more likely that The Store didn't remove them, but again this has no basis or confirmation. It is possible the bots were either sent to Sunnyvale if replaced, or thrown out if Not.

## Design

The Figures had 2 Eyes, black feathers, a yellow beak, black fluffed hair feathers, yellow feet, a yellow neck chain, &amp; a brow purse.
The Apperance may have been different on the Original Set of Figures but due to the obscurity of the promotional images, it's hard to confirm.

## Movements

The bot had 3 movements, which opened the mouth on the figures. It's unknown if the movements were tied into one signal or multiple.
