The ***Winchester Warblettes Animatronic*** was an animatronic produced in 1977 by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} for the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} location on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}. The bot used the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Hardware Setup" >}} for programming &amp; the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Control System" >}} for controlling the bots movements. The bot was replaced in 1981 when Winchester got {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}.

## History

### Production &amp; Manufacturing

Before the bot was created, Harold Goldbrandsen created concept art showing what the bot could do. The concept art had scrapped movements for the eyes, heads, &amp; hands. The bot was developed in early 1977 by Harold Goldbrandsen &amp; Fantasy Forest.

### Location Use

The bot was installed in {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} &amp; Programmed to the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Showtape" >}} in Early 1977. The bot was later programmed to the {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny Showtape" >}}, the {{< wiki-link "Madame Oink I" >}}, &amp; the {{< wiki-link "Foxy Colleen I" >}} from August 1978 to November 1978. The bot was seen in an episode of the Australian broadcast series, 'Four Corners' in their 'New Eatery Fad' segment(1).

### Fate

The bot was removed in 1981 when 'Winchester' got Cyberamics. The bot was sent to the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}} the same year &amp; left there until 1984, when they were thrown out during the move to the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}.

## Design
