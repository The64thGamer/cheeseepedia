<h2>History</h2>
Cerritos opened on September 25th, 2002 in Plaza 183. The location would not see any major remodels throughout its history for decades, though they would receive purple walls. Chuck originally featured the Cool Chuck outfit, but eventually received the Avenger outfit, with the cap being removed in September 2013. The location got a major exterior remodel in the summer of 2015 as part of the plaza's entire remodel, while the interior would continue to remain unremodeled. Eventually, they replaced the Avenger shirt with the Rockstar shirt. The curtains and the Studio C sign were removed at an unknown period. In the early 2020s, they would replace the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Clock (Animatronic)" >}} with a newer model from an unknown later Studio C Beta. Cerritos received 2.0 in May 2023, removing the Beta for the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}.
