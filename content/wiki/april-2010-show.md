## Trivia:

- There is no CEC TV logo for this show. Instead, the footage of the Studio C puppets appear on all versions of this show including those for Existing Stages. This would also mark the beginning of Studio C shows only having one video feed during segments. Puppet footage going forward would be part of the main footage and not a separate feed.
- This was the only show that was specifically programmed for it's {{< wiki-link "Star Stage" >}} equivalent which was being tested at the time.
- Due to the amount of content on the existing DVD the live shows had to be put on a separate DVD, and stores were also allowed to use the January 2010 DVD for live shows. It is currently unknown what lives were on the DVD.
- According to the *Valid Shows* section of the newsletter it states that the 'January Show Floppy' was allowed but doesn't mention the DVD for Studio C.
- This is the only show in 2010 to have featured new content.
- A brand new DVD #3 for Studio C was released for this show adding the current birthday show (Birthday 09) and new diagnostics for 16m and 32m bots. <sup>(1)</sup>
