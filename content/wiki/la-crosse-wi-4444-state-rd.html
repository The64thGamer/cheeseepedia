<h2>Stages</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
La Crosse opened on December 15th, 1982 as the fifth ShowBiz Pizza Place in Wisconsin, after Green Bay which opened nearly 2 months prior which is October 28th, Madison which opened 5 months prior which is July 7th & Milwaukee (Good Hope Rd & S 27th St, both opened a year prior in June 17th and August 27th, 1981, respectively) and as a corporate-owned store. La Crosse originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. In the mid-late 1990s, La Crosse received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights and some other decor, replaced the logo with Coach Chuck, and received SkyTubes. In 2006-2007, La Crosse received the 2005 Remodel removing older decor for newer decor, and removed the Showroom Walls. At some point in 2014, the entire plaza was rebuilt to accommodate the opening of the Dick's Sporting goods and La Crosse's exterior received the 2013 Update, as well as removing the portion of the entrance that was attached to movie theater where the Dick's Sporting Goods is currently. La Crosse would remain like this until June 2022, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the 3-Stage and replacing it with a <a href="https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Live_Stage_(Dance_Floor)"> Dance Floor + Video Wall</a>. Currently, as of March 2023, La Crosse still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall. Surprisingly, the road sign did not change, though the text is now white on a green background and now reads 'Chuck E. Cheese'.
