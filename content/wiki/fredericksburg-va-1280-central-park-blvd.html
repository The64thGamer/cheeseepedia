<h2> History </h2>
Fredericksburg originally opened on September 4th, 1999, with a Studio C Alpha. Fredericksburg would remodel to the 2005 Remodel in 2012 removing older decor for newer decor, removing Showroom Walls, and relocating the stage. They would close on May 29th, 2020, because of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Fredericksburg would stay vacant until June 9th, 2021, when work started on reopening the location. The rebuilding of the location would last 44 days when they did their soft opening on July 23rd, 2021, as <i>Chuck E. Cheese,</i> receiving the 2.0 Remodel and a Dance Floor and Video Wall, A few days in between their soft opening and grand opening they would finish minor changes such as enlarging the Chuck sign next to the video wall to make it look much more organized. They also did some changes to their kitchen. they were the second store to get the 2021 Model and Video Wall in Virginia, as Manassas got the first (and first 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall overall). A few of the employees at the Fredericksburg store before the closure were rehired before the soft opening.
Currently, as of July 2023, they still have the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor and Video Wall. They do not have a trampoline zone unlike the other Northern Virginia stores.
