<h2>History</h2>
Wilkes-Barre opened on April 21st, 2004 in the Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace (Alongside the now closed Butler, PA (101 Clearwater Circle)|Butler, PA location) with the Small Town Studio C & the Cool Chuck outfit. They then remodeled to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in around 2010-2012 which was an interior only (Keeping the Beverages Sign from opening) remodel and replacing the letters on the exterior. At some unknown point, Wilkes-Barre would expand into a neighboring beauty salon, most likely around their 2010-2012 remodel. The Cool Chuck shirt was replaced in around 2015-2016 with a Rockstar Shirt. In around 2018-2019, the Khaki Shorts were replaced with Rockstar Jeans. As of 2023, Wilkes-Barre has removed its 2005 update as of March 20th and its Phase 3 decor as of March 21st. The Cappa was removed a week later for the 2021 Model Dance Floor & Video Wall. Wilkes-Barre removed their signage on April 5th and received their new Chuck E. Cheese lettering in early May. Additionally, the exterior was repainted again after the mid-April repaint. The remodel concluded on May 11th, with the exception being that the new sign did not arrive in time for the grand reopening.
