Only 3 more stages would remain after this.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the 11th CEC would announce the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} would be wrapping up by the end of 2024. Only one other store with animatronics would be kept
        other than {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, that being {{< wiki-link "Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}} - a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} store with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}.<sup>(8)</sup> Employees being interviewed for the announcement were told they were prohibited from mentioning anything positive about the
        animatronics to prevent bad press about their removal.<sup>(5)</sup> In the same article CEC would also mention the stamps used to mark visitors for safety would instead soon be replaced with pictures taken of the family as they entered the establishment.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the 12th, Mark Kupferman would answer a few questions about the prior announcement. He would confirm that the Nanuet, NY location would be a 'hybrid store' like Northridge, CA, and not any of the themed stores from the previous month's survey. On a question on if the Nanuet animatronic would be worked on to finally be compatible with {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} shows, Mark would sidestep the answer to instead say that CEC had 'something cool planned' for the store. He would finally state that Nanuet being chosen does not have any affect on what future stores may also be chosen.<sup>(10)</sup> Kupferman would also later clarify that Nanuet was chosen after the survey results were submitted. He would then go on to express that Corporate is listening to the fans, however 'other considerations' are involved.<sup>(11)</sup>

        On the 13th {{< wiki-link "Altoona, PA (3415 Pleasant Valley Blvd)" >}}, one of the last stores holding a Concept Unification Stage, would receive the CEC 2.0 Remodel, replacing the animatronics. Only 2 more stages would remain after this.

        On the 23rd, David McKillips would announce that Mark Kupferman was visiting the {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}} location to make final decisions on their next remodel, implying it may get the same hybrid-store treatment as Northridge and Nanuet. This would be one of the highest voted shows in the {{< wiki-link "2024 CEC Future Planning Survey">}}.<sup>(13)</sup></li>
    <li>
        On the 24th, CEC would announce that it would be saving three more animatronic locations, being Charlotte Pineville-Matthews with a Concept Unification Stage, {{< wiki-link "Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}} with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}} with a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}}.<sup>(14)</sup> Mark Kupferman would later remark that this was the last stages the company would be keeping the animatronics in based on the highest voted locations in the 2024 CEC Future Planning Survey</a>.<sup>(15)</sup> The CEC Pop-Up Shop for employees would also open, featuring four new items.

        On the 11th, CEC would make a post to its stores confirming that the Nanuet, NY location would be a '100% retro store', which would include 'retro nights'. The retro nights wouldn't be explained, but said they would focus around the early 2000's era of CEC.<sup>(5)</sup><sup>(5)</sup>
    </li>
    <li>
        On the 12th, CEC would announce the Ninja Run, being a test addon to the Trampoline Zone. The announced test store would be {{< wiki-link "Grand Prairie, TX (2760 W I-20)" >}},  but the {{< wiki-link "Medford, OR (293 E Barnett Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Buffalo, NY (2638 Delaware Ave)" >}} and an unnamed Colorado location would also be rumored to receive it.<sup>(5)</sup><sup>(20)</sup>

    <li>
        On June 29th, Mark Kupferman would clarify that Nanuet, NY was not meant to be interpreted as a 'retro store' from a prior newsletter, but rather just a 'bonus location' to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/CEC Legacy Locations">}}">CEC Legacy Locations</a>. Its 'retro nights' and additional artwork was not intended to have expectations of its {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} stage being upgraded to a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} or that programming would be brought back for the store, but simply additions to make the store unique and interesting.<sup>(25)</sup><sup>(26)</sup><sup>(27)</sup>
