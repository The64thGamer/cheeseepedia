The <b><i>1978 Kooser Jasper T. Jowls Nameplate</b></i> appeared at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} located in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center in San Jose, California; placed under the {{< wiki-link "Kooser Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic)" >}} for the purpose of identifying the Jasper T. Jowls character.
<h2> Production </h2>
Alongside the other nameplates featured at the store, we can assume it was produced in a batch at the Fantasy Forest Manufacturing Company between October through November 1978, if not it was most likely produced by Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated; due to the significance of the character, it was most likely the second produced nameplate for the location after {{< wiki-link "PTT Kooser Chuck E Cheese Name Sign (1978)" >}}
<h2> Usage </h2>
The only usage of the nameplate was used at the 1371 Kooser Road location, placed under the {{< wiki-link "Kooser Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic)" >}} from as early as November 1978, and lasted to May 1980, where multiple scenarios could have played out after May 1980, those being:
<b>A.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and thrown out.</i>
<b>B.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and destroyed.</i>
<b>C.</b> <i>The nameplate was sent to the 1213 Innsbruck Drive corporate office in Sunnyvale, California, alongside the Kooser Portrait Animatronics.</i>
<h2> Design </h2>
Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated most likely ordered Fantasy Forest Manufacturing to design the Kooser batch of nameplates in a brown and yellow color scheme to stick out on the dark wall the portraits were placed on, while also following a style similar to the nameplates seen at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}
Much like all of the other nameplates seen at the 1371 Kooser Road store, Jasper T. Jowls nametag used a rounded brown, woodened base with the text 'Jasper T. Jowls' in yellow text, enclosed in a thin border of the same color, with supporting bolts on both the left and right side of the nameplate.<ol><li>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/promo/ptt/ptt_78kooser.pdf</li><li>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/cec/ptt_79foodservice.pdf</li><li>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/cec/ptt_79replay.pdf</li><li>https://youtu.be/4tgH_eThNZI</li></ol>
