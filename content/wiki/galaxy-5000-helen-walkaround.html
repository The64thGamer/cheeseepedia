The head used in the notorious CEC movie, <i>Chuck E. Cheese In The Galaxy 5000</i>, is the {{< wiki-link "Articulated Helen Walkaround" >}} that was created in 1996 by David “Billy Bob” Irvin.
Helen's outfit was her regular Helen Green Cheerleader (Costume Outfit)|cheerleader outfit but with the change of the colors now being purple and yellow, and the logos were removed. This was most likely done to accommodate for the films excessive use of green screen editing. The head was also modified for the film to have purple eyeshadow and purple bows, and her hair is slightly longer. Her bows are also placed on the top of her hair instead of just above her forehead.
