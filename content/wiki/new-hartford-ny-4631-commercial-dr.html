<b><i>4631 Commercial Dr</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on October 30, 2006 with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}, which closed in June 2020 during a wave of closures due to the company's bankruptcy.
This location is not to be confused with the <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> location, {{< wiki-link "New Hartford  Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike)" >}}, which was open from 1982-1985.
<h2> Stages </h2>
The location opened with the 'V3' variant of the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}. The stage remained intact until the location's closure.
The animatronic had its eyebrows and hat removed at some point during its history.
