***Chuck's Arcade* (Formerly Fun Spot Arcade)** is a division of {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese" >}} that manages arcades in hotels and malls across the country, starting in 2022 and continuing to the present day.
The concept would be the first time the company focused on a chain of small arcades since 1974 with the {{< wiki-link "Atari Family Game Center" >}} arcades.

## History

Due to CEC being one of the largest purchasers of arcade games, alongside its training regimen for staff to work on games, the company began pursuing the management of arcades in various hotels. Each deal would be worked out differently, with multiple designs and sets of machines fit for the hotel they reside in. Most of the arcades would reside in Simon-owned malls. The employees of the arcade itself are Chuck E. Cheese employees and are managed separately from the hotel employees.<sup>(1)(2)</sup> The first arcades did not use any CEC branding due to their separation from the standard locations.
In May of 2022, the first CEC-managed arcade would open at the Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites.<sup>(3)</sup> Chuck E. Cheese's Fun Zone is a little room with claw machines, and the arcade (just called Arcade) is across the lobby's hallway. The Fun Zone features the Rockstar era characters in rockets, while the arcade has pixel art of the rockets.<sup>(19)</sup>
On September 3, 2024, CEC's first press release on an arcade would be held for the {{< wiki-link "Trumbull, CT (5065 Main St)" >}} location. This would be the first instance of a branding for the arcade division, going under 'Fun Spot Arcade'. CEC would note this as a concept for all ages, being a departure from their usual '3-8' age range.<sup>(4)(5)(6)</sup>
On February 13, 2025, a new Fun Spot would be announced to open in the Mall of Georgia under the new name 'Chuck's Arcade'. On February 14th, Mark Kupferman would clarify that the new name would be a rebrand for Fun Spot and not a new variant of the arcade. The arcades are now set to have Chuck E. themed decor and light classic arcade theming, but no changes to the game selection or services.<sup>(8)(9)</sup>
On June 24, 2025, a fan discovered a {{< wiki-link "Pasqually (Cyberamic)" >}} displayed in a glass case at the Rockingham Park location.<sup>(12)</sup> This was the start of nostalgic elements coming to Chuck's Arcade, which would also include old art on the walls (for Ward Parkway) and more taxidermied animatronics.
CEC Corporate officially announced Chuck's Arcade on June 30th, 2025, which also revealed a new location in El Paso.<sup>(15)</sup> The news was picked up by multiple mainstream websites on July 2nd. <sup>(16)</sup>

## Known Locations

There are more locations than what is known. It is known that one arcade was installed in June of 2023 alongside that month's Orlando store refreshes.

## Taxidermy Animatronics

Some Chuck's Arcades have animatronics displayed in a glass case. They stand on a wooden base with the character's name on a Pizza Time Theatre-styled plate by their feet. The mechanisms inside were altered to make the characters have the right arm waving and the other by their side (besides Jasper's left arm).
