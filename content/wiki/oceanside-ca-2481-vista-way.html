<h2>History</h2>
Oceanside opened its doors on February 8th, 1983 (not confirmed) as a franchised location. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout as seen in many other stores across the United States. It was then sold to corporate on October 27th, 1986 along with {{< wiki-link "Bakersfield, CA (3760 Ming Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Fresno, CA (3117 W Shaw Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Visalia, CA (4345 W Noble Ave)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Escondido, CA (624 W Mission Ave)" >}}. Oceanside received the 1988 remodel removing older SPP decor for newer decor, a slight exterior remodel, and received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade. Unfortunately, there is hardly any documentation of Oceanside back then. In 1991, Oceanside received Concept Unification removing all SPP decor for newer decor, added an exterior change, and removed the Rock-Afire Explosion band for the 3-Stage. In the early-mid 90's, Oceanside underwent a minor remodel removing some decor for newer decor. Around the late 90's, the location received the so-called 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. Around 2000, their 3-Stage was removed for the Studio C Beta, 32m. Oceanside would remain like this until 2005-2006 when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing older 2000's decor for newer decor, a new exterior change, and the relocation of the stage. Oceanside remained like this until November 2021 when they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Beta for the Dance Floor. Currently, as of August 2024, the location still has the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Oceanside featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of Oceanside with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. they got Concept Unification sometime in 1991. In 2000, Oceanside removed their 3-Stage for the Studio C Beta. In November 2021, Oceanside removed the Studio C Beta, 32m for the Dance Floor for their 2.0 remodel.
