<b>Chuckfeld</b> is a 'Must C TV' parody poster released in 1998, it is a parody of <i>Seinfeld</i>.
<h2> Appearance </h2>
This features Chuck E. in a red cap and a Jerry Seinfeld outfit, stating 'Hey!! What's up with that?'
This also features non-disguised George Costanza, Elaine Benes, and Cosmo Kramer in the audience.
<h2> Size/Dimensions </h2>
Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.
<h2> Reception </h2>
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
