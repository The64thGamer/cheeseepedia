On January 18th, 1979, the store list under construction would be Concord, Stockton, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.{{< cite 2 >}} On February 12th, 1979, the store would be mentioned to open after Concord's planned opening of April of 1979.{{< cite 1 >}} On July 1st, 1979, Stockton would now be planned as the sixth store, opening after {{< wiki-link "Sacramento (Florin Mall), CA (7020 Stockton Blvd)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}.

### Opening
