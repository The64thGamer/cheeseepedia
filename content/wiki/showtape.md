A ***Showtape* is an interchangeable storage medium that holds audio, animation data for an animatronic stage, and sometimes video. The term is also used to describe the entirety of the audio-visual experience seen from a showtape playthrough.

This can also allow special limited time performances to happen without any laborious changes to the underlying show system.
