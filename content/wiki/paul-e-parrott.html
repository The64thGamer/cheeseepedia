Paul E. Parrott, also known as Paul E. Parrott's Pizza Place or Paul E. Parrott's Pizza N Games, was a pizza restaurant in Phoenix, AZ in the 1980s. The restaurant was incredibly obscure, to the point no photos of the building or the animatronics exist.

<h2> History </h2>

Paul E. Parrott's Pizza opened on July 18th, 1982. Its only location was at {{< wiki-link "Phoenix, AZ (1810 W. Montebello)" >}}. 

The restaurant shut down at some point in late 1983, with an auction being held on October 3rd to sell off the building's equpiment. Notably, the animatronics were specified as being sold "subject to owner's approval." The whereabouts of the show are still unknown.

<h2> Show </h2>

Paul E Parrott's boasted an animatronic show, however no photographs exist. According to an illustration in a newspaper ad, aside from the titular character (a green and red parrot), there were three other members of the band- a rabbit playing a tambourine, a panda playing the guitar, and a raccoon playing the trumpet. The band would allegedly play every fifteen minutes and had a set list of five songs, plus a version of the birthday song that could be played at special request.

Local entertainers Wallace & Ladmo often performed at Paul E.'s, appearing during its grand opening and as part of a telethon held on January 22nd & 23rd, 1983.
