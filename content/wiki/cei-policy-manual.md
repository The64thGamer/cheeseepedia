The ***Creative Engineering, Inc. Policy Manual* is a lost manual for CEI employees.
The only evidence of the manual's existence is a scan of the front cover art, drawn by Dave Thomas.<sup>(1)</sup> The manual was half-letter sized, being 8.5' x 5.5'.<sup>(2)</sup>**

## Lost Media

The currently only known copy was located in *Snapper's Blast to the Past Museum*, which burned from a fog machine accident in October of 2010. The manual was not recovered from the rubble.<sup>(2)(4)</sup>
