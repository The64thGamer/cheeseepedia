The 1991 update to the ShowBiz Chuck E Cheese walk around head saw a few updates compared to its 90 counter part. The ears are shaped smaller and more narrow, smaller teeth that are now sculpted to the head, and a red bowtie. This new style head went into production as early as Feb of 1991.
<h2> Trivia </h2><ul><li>This head made an unexpected appearance in the Spring 2014 showtape, where the Grizzly Bear character tells the Centaur character that he's in disbelief that a mouse would be wearing a tuxedo. This appearance has him wearing a top hat instead of a derby, though.<sup>(1)</sup></li></ul>
