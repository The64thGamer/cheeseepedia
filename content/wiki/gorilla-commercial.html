<b><i>Gorilla</b></i> is a lost ShowBiz Pizza Place commercial that aired in local television stations in 1981. The only evidence this commercial exists is a 1981 franchise brochure, however this may just be the official name for {{< wiki-link "SPP Davenport (Commercial)" >}}. The tape box shows the ad was mastered on June 30th, and the brochure claims the ad could easily be adapted for local use.
