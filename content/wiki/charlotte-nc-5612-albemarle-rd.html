<b><i>5612 Albemarle Rd, Store #39</b></i> also known as <b></b>Albemarle<b></b> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened in November 1991 as a franchised location with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}} which is still open to this day.
This is not to be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (4120 E Independence Blvd)" >}} location (Which was 5-7 minutes from this location) opened on March 30th, 1982, and closed in October 1984 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. It should also not be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}} location as it opened on October 11th, 1982, with the Rock-Afire Explosion which is still open to this day with a 3-Stage.
<h2>History</h2>
<h3> Pre CEC (October 1984-February 1991) </h3>
Prior to the store's opening, the store's space sat as three small shops, including Milton's Clothing Cupboard (October 1984-March 1986), Jesse Brown's Outdoors (November 1984-1986) & Leaf 'N Petal (November 1984-spring 1987), the plaza would start construction in around Mid-Late 1983. Then in July 1987, it became Cloth World which remained open until February 1991, with CEC starting construction in the building not long after.
<h3> CEC (November 1991-Present) </h3>
The store would then open in November 1991 at an unknown day as one of two North Carolina locations with a Cyberamic Munch's Make-Believe Band Stage (the other is {{< wiki-link "Durham, NC (3724 Mayfair St)" >}} which opened on March 7th, 1994, with a 1-Stage). It was also a franchised location when it first opened. This location opened with the 1988 Remodel with the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990's, They replaced the logo with Coach Chuck (Which was actually white alongside the lettering) and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and SkyTubes. On December 8th, 1997, the store was acquired by Corporate, alongside {{< wiki-link "Richmond, VA (10430 Midlothian Turnpike)" >}}. In 2009, they remodeled to the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the showroom walls (A small portion of the left-hand side of their Showroom was sacrificed for more Gameroom Space), removing older decor for newer decor, & adding purple walls. Sometime in 2015, Charlotte (Albemarle); alongside the Charlotte NC area stores ({{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Concord, NC (7970 Lyles Lane)" >}}, & {{< wiki-link "Gastonia, NC (416 Cox Rd)" >}} and some other markets tested the Play Pass system. Sometime around March of 2024, the entire shopping center would be repainted, giving a white paint job to the store's exterior. As of July 2024, the location still exists with the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor with the Video Wall.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Like all Road Stages when they first opened, Chuck wore his Tuxedo & Derby outfit. Also, the stage featured no curtains like any other Road Stage from when it was first installed. Up and Down curtains were added by 1998. In the Early 2000's this was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the Late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. After the 2000's and into the 2010's, Chuck was then given Pasqually's eyebrows and the Wink's eye was then broken and tilted. This is the last location with the Road Stage style Helen mask. The store's stage would later fall under disrepair by 2022. In March/April 2024, Pasquallyâ€™s jaw would fall out. In June 2024, the Road Stage was removed.
Charlotte then began their {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, obtaining their dance floor and video wall within a couple days. Their Road Stage was the last one in the entire United States, as the final Road Stage in existence is at the {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)" >}} location.
