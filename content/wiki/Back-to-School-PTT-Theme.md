The ***Pizza Time Theatre Back to School Theme*** was a temporary alteration to the stage and character designs for use in the 1985 {{< wiki-link "CEC Back to School" >}} showtape.**

## Stage Design

The backdrop behind the characters would feature a yellow school bus with a green background. On the school bus the text would read 'School Days'. Inside each window was a character (from left to right) there was Mitzi, Munch, ???, Jasper, Helen, ???, and Billy Bob, they would be placed behind the middle section of the Balcony.
