<b><i>Munch Mouth</b></i> is an arcade machine used in {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}}.
<h2> Gameplay </h2>
The gameplay is unknown, but from the photo we have it seems like you would shoot balls into munch's teeth knocking them down one by one. there was also likely a score to like other games of this type and a timer that would count down to 0.
