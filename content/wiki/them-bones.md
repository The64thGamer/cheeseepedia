***'Them Bones'*** was a road show which was first released in September 2012 on the {{< wiki-link "Road Show 2012" >}} CD, though it was only intended to be played during October. It would make its live show debut exclusively on Weigl stages in October 2012. It would return as both a road show and a live show for all stages in October 2014. It would then return a final time in October 2015. This live show was meant to promote Chucktober.

## Summary

The video for this live show featured skeletons dancing on a stage, with text appearing when singing about how the bones are connected.

### Countdowns
In October 2012, this live show would be accompanied by a five-minute countdown featuring Michael Hill occasionally talking to the audience. An edited version of this countdown with different music and text, as well as an added voiceover, would be used in October 2014.

In October 2015, the countdown would feature a girl getting ready for the live show by doing various activities. An announcement would also be added to the end for the ticket splash.
