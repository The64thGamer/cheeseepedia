The <b>Ticket Muncher</b> is an attraction found at Chuck E. Cheese's locations. It was introduced in 2000, during Phase 3, which ran until 2003, and also removed ball pits, and also added Toddler Zone|Toddler Zones. They were formerly used to count how many tickets you had from its inception until around August-September 2020, when the COVID-19 Pandemic forced CEC to remove paper tickets, replacing them with 'Chuck E-Tickets', which are placed onto the Play Pass card system. Many locations have since removed their Ticket Munchers, although some may still have them, just not being in any use.
