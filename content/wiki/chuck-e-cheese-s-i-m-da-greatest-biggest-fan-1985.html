I wanna tell you but I'm not very bold
Could ya understand what I'm being told
You were a child when I left you alone
Well now I'm back and I wanna stay home
I broke your heart it was so long ago
Your mother said that you would need me so
Go by my future's what I thought I'd do
But now I realize my future is you
I am sincere and I hope you'd accept
Then I'm so sorry and I'm filled with regret
Please take me back as your father once more
Don't leave me standing outside your front door
I feel so lonely and sad and old that I can't make it all up to you
I know you can't understand
Just give me the chance
I'll show you what I'll do, just for you
I'll take ya out if you want me to
I'm gonna be very nice to you
I'm gonna pick you up in my big Sedan
You're gonna find out I'm your biggest fan
