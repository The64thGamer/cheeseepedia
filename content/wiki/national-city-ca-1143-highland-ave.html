In around 1994, {{- wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" -}} was removed for the {{- wiki-link "2-Stage" -}}.

<h2> History </h2>

In 1989/1990, National City received the {{- wiki-link "SPT 1988 Remodel Program" -}}, removing all PTT traces and removed the Balcony Stage for {{- wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" -}}.
Around 1994, National City received {{- wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" -}}, removing all 1980s decor and removed {{- wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" -}} for a {{- wiki-link "2-Stage" -}}.
