Chuck E.'s Play Band is a wrist band system at {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} restaurants, used to play games in the restaurants. Chuck E's Play Band was first implemented in 2018, as an alternative to the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Play Pass" >}}, which had been in use since late 2016. E-Tickets, introduced in late 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic as the replacement to physical paper tickets, are stored on the Play Band's as well.

<h2>Designs</h2>
Chuck E's Play Band currently is available in 3 colors: Purple, Red, and Green. The overall design of the three colors are the same with stars, and Chuck E. jumping with his fist in the air and smiling. On the other side of the Play Band is 'Chuck E. Cheese's' in the official font of the wordmark for CEC, which has been in use since the early 1990's. In the middle is a bigger star, which is where the NFC reader (tech used to activate games) is located.
<h2> Ways To Play </h2>
The way to activate a game using the Play Band, a player has to tap the Play Band on the Play Pass reader, located on the game, usually where the token slots used to be. The star on the Play Band is where the technology is to activate the game. There is a color changing play button that will turn green when the game is activated and will red when there are insufficient Play Points or Play Time has expired.
There are two different ways of playing games with the Play Band, the first is Play Points, which are a set amount of plays (like tokens), and the second is Play Time, which is a set amount of time (i.e. 30 Minutes, 1 Hour.) with unlimited plays until the time expires.
