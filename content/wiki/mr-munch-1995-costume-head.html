Mr, Munch’s 1995 update changed his sculpt slightly compared to the 1993 model, this one being smaller in an attempt to be in scale with the new style, 1994 Chuck E. walkaround. He’s also not as wide around the cheeks as the earlier models. Mr., Munch’s sculpt added ventilation holes as well as a hole at the top of his head. Munch came with a green and white hat to hide the hole. This would be the last sculpt update to Munch as later version only changed the fur pattern on the top of his head to cover up the hole that would be visible without his hat.
