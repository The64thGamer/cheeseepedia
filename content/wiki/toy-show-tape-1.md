***Toy Show Tape 1* was the showtape used for Billy Bob's Toyland Adventure Show, which featured at the *IAAPA* in November of 1995.
The showtape was presumably sent alongside the show to the Family Entertainment Center that purchased it from South America.**

## IAAPA Debut

The showtape would debut at the IAAPA 1995 convention along with the Toyland stage itself. To the left of the stage was the New RAE Lite-CS with Karaoke and NRAE Mini Stage. Each show would play a single segment before passing it onto the next stage. The only [footage of this showtape](https://youtu.be/I-uKRa6aa5M?t=465) during the convention comes from *Brian Hagan*, who uploaded it onto YouTube on December 18, 2021, featuring *Segment 13: Hot Fun in the Summertime.*
