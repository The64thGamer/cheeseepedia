The <b><i>Pizza Time Theatre Showtape</b></i> was the first ever {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} showtape to be made, premiering with the opening of the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} location on May 17, 1977.
The showtape debuted the original <i>Pizza Time Players</i>, including the short-lived <i>Crusty the Cat.</i>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Big Cheese Birthday Show</h3>
The first production work on the showtape was a 2-track tape containing a showtape concept demo recording produced on October 7, 1976.<sup>(3)</sup>
The tape features 'The Big Cheese' (whom later on became {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese" >}}), and Crusty the Cat performing dialogue. The audio would be produced at <i>Wally Heider Studio</i> (245 Hyde St., San Francisco, CA, 94102). The script for the session was written by Robert “Bob” Allan Black under the direction of Atari, Gene Landrum, and Nolan Bushnell. The producer for the show would be <i>Ed Bogus Productions</i> (680 Beach St. Suite 495, San Francisco, CA 94109).<sup>(4)</sup><sup>(3)</sup>
<h3>Demo Recordings</h3>
Sometime between late 1976 and early 1977 more demo tracks would be recorded, this time featuring the full cast of characters. The tracks has John Widelock as most of the characters, with Scott Paulin making a small appearence as Jasper in the theme song, and the Warblettes being voiced by Buffy Sainte-Marie.<sup>(1)</sup>
<br>
These tracks include:
<ul>
    <li>Bye Bye Blackbird</li>
    <li>The Can-Can</li>
    <li>Cocktails For Two</li>
    <li>How Much is that Doggie in the Window</li>
    <li>Pasqually Show</li>
    <li>Introducing the Pizza Time Orchestra</li>
    <li>Pizza Time Theatre Theme Song (Demo Version)</li>
    <li>The Drive In</li>
    <li>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy</li>
</ul>
The demo tapes take a majority of their music and skits from other albums directly. The Can-Can skit directly uses 'Offenbach - Morpheus' from the album 'Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics'. Crusty's French singing is of Spike's voice, alongside Spike's sneezing skit at the end being recontextualized as Jasper.<sup>(5)</sup>
<br>
The Pasqually Show has the opening car skit taken from 'Liszt - Rhapsody From Hunger(y)' from the same 'Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics' album, followed by the main melody sung over 'Funiculi, Funicula' from the album 'Italia Mia' by Mantovani.<sup>(6)</sup>
<h3>Release</h3>
The showtape would be previewed early on May 1st, 1977 for the Atari Coin-Op Division. The Corporate Building and Pinball Division would preview on May 4th, and the Consumer Division would see it on May 5th. The general public would see the showtape on opening day on May 17th.<sup>(5)</sup>

<h3> D2 Tape / CD Recording </h3>
At some point after the original showtape was produced, the original audio of the recording sessions, alongside edited and final audio for multiple Winchester store showtapes would be copied to D2 tape and eventually CDs, which is the only currently known surviving record of that era's contents. The segments on the tape included the original voice demos for the showtape, along with original copies of reference songs in the showtape. Some of the showtape tracks are also edited versions, which feature cuts, updates, and raw music tracks.<sup>(1)</sup>
