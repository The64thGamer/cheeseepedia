The <b><i>SPP</i> <i>Yogi Bear Showtape</b></i> was a showtape that ran in three ShowBiz Pizza Place locations (Omaha, NE, Colorado Springs, CO, and Augusta, GA) in June 1987 as part of a test to bring licensed characters to ShowBiz Pizza in the hopes to eventually phase The Rock Afire Explosion out of restaurants.
<h2> Discovery </h2>
After the limited run of The Yogi Bear Stage, the showtape was presumed lost due to its short run in stores, and only running in three stores. The showtape’s audio was revealed in August 2020 by Steve White, who had produced the show.
<h2> Summary </h2>
Segment one begins with Fatz asking the remaining Rock Afire Explosion members what they’ve never had before. After a few guesses, it’s revealed they’ve never had a guest star before (Which is false due to Uncle Klunk having debuted in 1983), and the band performs <i>Who Can It Be Now?</i> to build the anticipation. After the song, Yogi is introduced with the <i>Yogi Bear Theme Song</i>. Yogi’s curtains open and he introduces himself and his sidekick Boo Boo, who is afraid of Fatz. The band then performs <i>I’m So Excited</i>, with Yogi providing backup vocals. The segment ends with Boo Boo saying he’s excited, with Yogi agreeing as the song finishes.
Segment two begins with Yogi’s curtains opening early and him asking the patrons to share their pizza with him. Eventually Boo Boo and the rest of the band scold him for this, which prompts Yogi to sing <i>Hungry</i>. After the song, rest of the Rock Afire Explosion tell Yogi that Mr. Ranger is in the audience by describing parts of him (Medium, dark hair, park ranger hat and uniform), with Fatz explaining that Mr. Ranger would be dropping in to watch Yogi and that he requested the band to play <i>Every Breath You Take.</i>
Segment three begins with Mitzi admitting she has a crush on one of the guest stars, refusing to elaborate before singing <i>Let’s Hear it for the Boy</i>. After the song, Yogi and Boo Boo discuss entertaining the guests out in the audience, before showing the Rock Afire Boo Boo’s soft-shoe routine, which leads to Fatz asking about bringing their act into the modern times, and Beach Bear singing <i>Rock and Roll Star</i>. Yogi closes the segment by saying “And I can rock and roll better than the average bear!”
