<b><i>Stockton, CA (4555 N Pershing Ave)</b></i> also known as <b></b>Pershing<b></b> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened in October 1979 (day unknown) as a corporate <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> with a Balcony Stage Show and closed in December 1998 with the 2-Stage.
This store reopened to the {{< wiki-link "Stockton, CA (6436 Pacific Ave)" >}} location after nearly 7 years of its absence and is still open to this day. The new location is about 7 minutes away from the original location.
<h2>History</h2>
Stockton opened its doors in October 1979 with a Portrait Stage. It was originally a franchised-owned Pizza Time Theatre location until October 22, 1984, when corporate bought this location and 50 other locations. Around 1981 or 1982, they would receive their first minor remodel involving the exterior logo change, and the removal of the Portrait Stage for the Balcony Stage. In the Late 80's, Stockton would receive the 1988 remodel and removed older decor for newer decor, an exterior change, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. In 1993 or 1994, Stockton would receive a minor remodel, this time another change to the exterior, older decor removed for newer ones, and Chuck E.'s House Facade being removed for the 2-Stage. Around 1996 or 1997, the location received a minor exterior remodel removing older decor for newer decor. In December 1998, the location closed for unknown reasons. We believe it is most likely because of parking issues. After Stockton closed, it became a banquet which closed around an unknown year. Currently, as of February 2023, the location is still abandoned and the red doors from when it was Chuck E. Cheese during their 1996 or 1997 remodel is surprisingly still there, although all Chuck E. Cheese remnants inside have since been long gone.
<h2>Stages</h2>
When Stockton opened, it housed a Portrait Stage like the other Pizza Time Theatres that opened at the time. Unfortunately, there are hardly any videos and no exterior photos to exist of Stockton before closure. Sometime in 1981 or 1982, the Portrait Stage was converted into the Balcony Stage. Sometime between the Late 80's, they removed the Balcony Stage and installed {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. This location would get a 2-Stage installed in 1993 or 1994.
In December 1998, Stockton closed and removed the 2-Stage. A new location would open nearly 7 years later.
