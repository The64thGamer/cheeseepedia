<h2> History </h2>
In 1981, After PTT went public, plans were made to develop international locations, a location was set to open in Australia.  The location was in a entertainment venue called 'Grundy's Paradise Centre' in Surfer's Paradise, Queensland. The location had a Balcony styled Shelf Stage, Dolli Dimples as the Cabaret act, and Madame Oink as the guest star. The Showtape used was probably either {{< wiki-link "Around the World with Madam Oink" >}} or Madame Oink III - 'Tunnel of Love'. The location would be featured on an Australian News Broadcast in 1981 & another the same year. The Location closed in 1982 & was relocated to {{< wiki-link "Carina, Queensland, Australia" >}}.
