<b><i>4039 S Noland Rd, Store #82</b></i> was a Showbiz Pizza Place that opened on October 14, 1980 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which relocated in May 2012.
This location was the 6th Showbiz to open, and the 5th RAE installed, they would receive Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and still have the 3-Stage until closure.
<h2> History </h2>
Independence opened on October 14, 1980 and was the second Showbiz Pizza Place opened in the state of Missouri. It had a Rock-Afire Explosion and was also a franchised location until on February 25th, 1985 when it was bought by the corporate along with {{< wiki-link "Overland Park, KS (10510 Metcalf Lane)" >}}. They received the 1988 remodel which removed the older SPP decor for newer decor. In 1991 or 1992, they received Concept Unification which removed the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage, a new exterior remodel, and the removal of all SPP decor for CEC decor. In the Mid-Late 90's, they received Phase 3 which involves the removal of older decor, addition of newer decor, and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until {{< wiki-link "Independence, MO (18701 E 39th St)" >}} in May 2012.<sup>(1)</sup> After they relocated, they were abandoned for 8 years until being demolished in November 2020, with an Andy's Frozen Custard being built on the site in Fall 2021. Currently, as of June 2023, the location has been demolished for Andy's Frozen Custard which is still there.
<h2> Stages</h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, they were the 5th RAE installed, and originally had the 'Beta' bots, which had hollow frames, unlike the later ones, which have solid frames. They would replace the original bots in 1981, as all other 'Beta' shows. In around 1991 or 1992, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. Chuck E's curtains were broken around 2000<sup>(2)</sup>. It was removed in May 2012 because of their relocation.
