<b><i>Dog</b></i> (also known as <b><i>The Dog</b></i>) was a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Mr Munch (Cyberamic)" >}} used at the {{< wiki-link "Fun Zone & Pizza" >}} on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}}. The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> As Mr. Munch </h3>
The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. The bot also replaced its former arm mechanics for new arm mechanics
<h3> As The Dog </h3>
In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Dog uses a generic mascot costume instead of the Munch Cyberamic ones, though they still had the originally Keyboard from their 2-Stage. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.
When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
