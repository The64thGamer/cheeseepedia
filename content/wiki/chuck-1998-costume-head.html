The 1998 update to the Chuck E. Cheese walkaround head included these updates, dark gray eye lids, lighter ear fur, and smaller, upward pointed nose. This head went into production in late 1997 and was first seen in the 'Pondwatch' skit in the January 1998 Show. Bow tie holes are still present on this head.
