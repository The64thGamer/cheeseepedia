The articulated Helen walkaround head was created in 1996 by former Creative Engineering employee, David “Billy Bob” Irving.
<h2> History </h2>
The articulated walkaround heads were created by 'Billy Bob' Irving for Showbiz Pizza Time to be used for on-screen appearances from 1996 to 1997.
In preparation for the Galaxy 5000 movie, the articulated head was refurbished by Billy Bob. In the process, Helen's hair became longer and the hairbows are bigger and placed on the top of her hair instead of just above the forehead. Helen's eyeshadow was also changed to purple, likely to avoid interfering with the heavy usage of green-screening during production.
As of 2024, it is unknown of where the head or any other accompanying parts could be.
<h2> Appearance </h2>
The walkaround is based off of the standard Helen used in stores from 1994 to then, the only difference being the new articulated head.
