<b><i>Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall), Store #448</b></i> was a <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> that opened on December 16, 1983 as a franchised location with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}. The store is located in a  freestanding building right outside of the Lehigh Valley Mall.
As of April 2024, this location has the 2.0 remodel.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Whitehall featured a Rock-afire Explosion which was originally from the {{< wiki-link "Abilene, TX (1874 S Clack St)" >}} ShowBiz that closed not long before then, as all other ShowBiz locations at the time did. Unfortunately, there are some photos but no videos to exist of Whitehall with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. they got {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} sometime between 1991 and 1992.
In 2010 they remodeled to have the characters on one stage, this would be called the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}} by fans. Chuck is was wearing the avenger shirt and jeans, and the rest of the band has the usual cosmetics minus Helen loosing her flower in 2018. On July 12, 2023, the stage was removed as apart of the location receiving the 2.0 remodel and was replaced with the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
<h2>History </h2>
Whitehall opened its doors on December 16th, 1983 as the last ShowBiz Pizza store in Pennsylvania, in a  freestanding building right outside of the Lehigh Valley Mall. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout (Except that the show was on the right side wall opposed to being on the back wall) seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Whitehall was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Whitehall received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade. The store eventually made the decision to close in 1989 before the 1988 Remodel.<sup>(1)</sup> On January 16th, 1990, Whitehall was acquired by Corporate. Whitehall then underwent Concept Unification in around 1991, converting the RockAfire Explosion into Munch's Make Believe Band. In late 2010 the store remodeled to house the new {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}} (Which was one of three installed and was the first one to install it. The other two were located at the {{< wiki-link "Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}} & {{< wiki-link "Columbus, GA (3201 Macon Rd)" >}}) which involved expanding the gameroom and moving the show to the back wall. By early July 2023, the store would begin its 2.0 remodel, removing the stage by July 12th. They had it's grand reopening of the store 2 months later on September 7th, 2023.
