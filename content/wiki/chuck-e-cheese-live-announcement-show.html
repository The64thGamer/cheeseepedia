<b><i>Chuck E. Cheese LIVE Announcement Show</i></b> was a Cyberamics showtape used exclusively for a livestreamed announcement regarding the first of the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}. The tape would premiere November 2nd, 2023.

<h2>History</h2>
The showtape would be produced sometime in September to October, and filmed for its only debut- through a social media announcement- in October at {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, for which the show canonically takes place in.
<br>
The show would be sent as a temporary fireable to all CEC-Stage {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} setups, though was only permitted to play for the filming.<sup>(3)</sup>
<br>
<h3>Filming & Video Edits</h3>
The original tape would have the audience questions voiced by Matt Daniel to sound like a stereotypical old-timey reporter, where they would be redubbed in the video to be other unknown voices. After Munch's comment on Southern California being the band's favorite place to perform, the original tape had Pasqually joke about being on pins and needles to see the ocean. In the video it transitions from the skit to Together We Got It right at Helen's first singing line, but the actual segment completes and plays the song from the very beginning.
<br><br>
The filmed segment had a few issues with the stage, such as Jasper's jaw being slow to move back into a closed position, and the main stage spotlights not functioning. 
<h3>Announcement</h3>
The video for the show would be set for a premiere countdown on October 25, 2023, set for 8 days later on November 2nd.<sup>(4)</sup> The description would state:
<blockquote>
"Chuck E. Cheese has big news to share with fans young and old. Tune in on November 2 at 1pm ET | 12pm CST to hear this important LIVE announcement. You wonâ€™t want to miss this!"
</blockquote>
<h3> Livestream Troubles </h3>
The stream would debut to 335 viewers on YouTube, and unknown amount on Facebook.<sup>(2)</sup> The YouTube stream would be the first to debut, but during the last 30 seconds the entire video would be muted. The Facebook stream would accidentally start midway into the video, skipping the entire announcement segment.
CEC would then pivot the stream to Instagram, where it would debut to 534 viewers and successfully play without issue, alongside posting it to LinkedIn.<sup>(1, 2)</sup> 50 minutes later, after getting several confused comments on the Facebook stream, a second restream of the event would be held with the new name 'ðŸš¨BREAKING NEWS: Chuck E. Cheese Press Conference'.
<h3>Unofficial Plays</h3>
On November 10th, 2024, exactly one year from the original Northridge Grand Re-Opening Party, a video of the full tape being performed would surface online. The tape would play at the {{< wiki-link "Tinley Park, IL (16090 S Harlem Ave)" >}} location through a ripped copy of the tape being reuploaded to the Navori System, unveiling for the first time the cut parts from the original broadcast. Other locations had privately played the tape when it was briefly available a year prior, but none had surfaced.<sup>(6)</sup>
