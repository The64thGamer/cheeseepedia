On January 8, 1984, the ShowBiz Pizza Place would close as 'part of a series of 40 closings and sales designed to trim operations in 'over-saturated' markets.(2)

In 1985 a nightclub named 'Sneaker's' (also known as Sneaker's Nite Club) opened up inside the former ShowBiz Pizza Place(9) Soon after the nightclub would be renamed 'Sneakers of Cincinnati' In 1987 'Sneakers of Cincinnati' would close due to failing to pay rent. An auction would be held on December 29, 1987 at 10:00am.
