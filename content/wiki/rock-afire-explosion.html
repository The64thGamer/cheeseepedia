The <b><i>Rock-afire Explosion</b></i> was an animatronic show created by {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering" >}} for {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} from 1980 to 1983, which would be used in its restaurants until parent company ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. rolled out {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} in SPP locations with a Rock-afire show from June 1990 to March 1993.
Most remaining Rock-afire shows were turned into Chuck E. Cheese 3-Stage|3-Stages, which are also being dwindled down due to the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}. Creative Engineering would continue to use its spare shows to sell to family entertainment centers as-is, {{< wiki-link "Moonrockers" >}}, or with new additions such as video and karaoke throughout the 80's and 90's.
<h2> History </h2>
The Rock-afire Explosion would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} on August 14th of that year. The characters were based off the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} animatronic show Creative Engineering had previously developed.
