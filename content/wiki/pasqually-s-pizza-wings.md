***Pasqually's Pizza & Wings* was a Chuck E. Cheese's ghost kitchen delivery service that featured the Munch's Make Believe Band member {{< wiki-link "Pasqually" >}} as the namesake.**

## History

The service would start in March of 2020 when all Chuck E. Cheese locations closed for carryout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later on in the year backlash against the service would spread after general consumers realized they were purchasing CEC pizza under a different branding. Following the backlash the would update their menu with exclusive items to differentiate from CEC's offerings. In 2023 the items would be available to purchase in-store as part of a new Grown-Up Menu.<sup>(1)</sup> On October 17th, 2023, CEC would announce a collaboration with Raging Waters Sacramento Water Park to have a CEC branded section of the waterpark be made to debut in the parks re-opening as California Dreamin'. The site would be set to have a physical Pasqually's Pizza & Wings location in the area.<sup>(3)</sup>

### Closing

On March 21, 2025, it would be internally announced that Pasqually's would close at the end of the month, having the service last exactly five years. Pasqually's items that had been moved to the Grown-Up Menu would also be slated to be discontinued in mid-late April of 2025.<sup>(2)</sup>
