## Cylinder Rebuilding

An official procedure for cylinder rebuilding is documented in the ShowBiz Pizza Place Operations Manual from 1981.

> 1.  Remove front or rear face of cylinder
> 2.  Remove piston
> 3.  Remove nose seal and 'O' rings
> 4.  Clean all parts with a clean rag and denatured alcohol
> 5.  Coat piston and new seals with packer lube
> 6.  Install the new 'O' rings (flanges facing each other)
> 7.  Coat the cylinder wall with parker 'O-ring' lube
> 8.  Lube piston rod with 10 weight non-detergent oil
> 9.  Reassemble NOTE: It is advisable to rebuild the cylinder on a clean piece of paper or newspaper. This will help prevent foreign matter finding its way inside your newly rebuilt cylinder.
