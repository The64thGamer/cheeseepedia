The ***New Rock-afire Lite Stage* was a stage designed in the 90s, designed as a cheaper alternative to the New Rock-afire Explosion stage, with only 2 stages instead of 3.**

## Design

The stage features two stages containing separate visual scenes alongside their animatronic characters, and a turntable on stage center.
Stage Center features a turntable, with three smaller turntables. There is a character on each smaller turntable, the characters featured are Billy Bob, Mitzi, and Fatz. On the wall behind the turntable, is various props and lighting effects. There are 4 big speakers on the stage, which have movements on them. There is an organ, EQ equipment, horns, and 2 levers across the walls. Above the organ are 4 Neon music notes that light up. at the back of the stage are 2 neon signs that say 'Rock-afire' and 'Explosion'. There are also various plastic half spheres of different sizes and colors placed on the back wall, and plastic music notes, along with a White circle, a lightning bolt, a star, and a heart, all of which have lights pointed at them.
Stage Left features the TV Animatronic, and a Pink wall with wallpaper, the wallpaper being White with Pink Rabbits. This stage variant has this turntable fixed in this position, without Dook Larue on the other side.
The outside of the stage featured a Silver Sparkle curtain spanning across all two sub-stages. Silver Sparkle curtains would conceal the stages, before raising up when a show started. The show was also raised a few feet off the ground, making it just near the height of any tables that would normally block the view. Away from the stage would feature the character spotlights hanging from the ceiling, each pointed at the cast.
