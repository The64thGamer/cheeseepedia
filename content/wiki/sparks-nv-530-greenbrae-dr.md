## History

### Pre-Opening

The first mentioning of the location would be in December of 1979, noting that the location would be opening on December 20th, and having its Grand Opening Party on Janury 7th of 1980. It would also be noted that the store was the first franchised location, owned by Gary Harwin, which would also be the store's manager. Gene Finnigan, a contractor for PTT which had built 3 previous stores, and now the Sparks location, would be co-owning the venture as well.{{< cite 2 >}} PTT would also note that they had previously recieved a $2,000,000 loan from Bank of America to expand stores into new areas, with this being likely one of the first stores to use that.{{< cite 1 >}} Gary and his wife, Cindy, would get PTT themed licensed plates for their new venture, with hers reading "PIZZA TME", and his reading "PZATME"{{< cite 2 >}}

### Opening

The store would open on December 20th, 1979. Sparks Mayor of the time, Ron Player, would greet the newcomer to the state, saying "We're delighted to have Pizza Time join the Sparks scene. Our city is growing at a phenomenal rate and this is a great addition.".{{< cite 2 >}} On January 7th, 1980, the store would have its Grand Opening.{{< cite 1 >}} At the grand opening, Cindy Harwin would hide diamond earrings in the pizza of a friend by the request of the friend's husband, who was unable to make it to the opening and was celebrating his 20th anniversary back in Los Angeles.
