The <b>Name That Cheese (CEC Décor)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's in 1998.
<h2> Design </h2>
This poster features Chuck E. Cheese hosting a game show called 'Name That Cheese' with the contestants being Mr. Munch, a lady, and a man named Doug with Helen being the assistant showing off the prize which is a piece of cheese. While in the audience, Jasper is being the camera operator and Pasqually is watching the show.
<h2> Size/Dimensions </h2>
Exact measurements are unknown, but this poster is exact same size as the SPT Décor.
<h2> Reception </h2>
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
