<h2> Summary </h2>
The tape goes over performing as a Cast Member for all duties in the restaurant. It additionally focuses on Live Shows, Road Shows, and Birthday Parties.
The video follows Joey, Kelley, and Robert Gotcher as they pretend to be peering through a restaurant with security cameras and following the Cast Member's jobs as they perform. Midway through Aaron comes out in a Chuck E. Avenger suit to describe how to properly perform in the walkarounds. Heather then shows how to do Road Shows.
