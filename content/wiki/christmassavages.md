***A Christmas Gift Show for Rock-Afire Savages and Fans*** is a showtape uploaded to the Creative Engineering YouTube channel for Christmas of 2025.{{< cite 2 >}}

## History

The video would be the first showtape since the Mst3k song in 2021 to have all characters current voice actors be present, whether reprising old roles or new VA's filling in.{{< cite 1 >}} It would also be the first multi-segmented new show since the {{< wiki-link "Electronic Arts Awards Show" >}} in 2010, the first multi-segment with other VA's outside Aaron reprising since the {{< wiki-link "Bear Review Showtape" >}} in October 2000, and the first proper full tape- with the full cast- with no reused segments- since {{< wiki-link "SPP Bach to Rock / Dance Contest" >}} in 1988.

The show is also the first appearance of Shooter Jennings as Fatz (though only through a prerecorded song from 2012), with the debut originally going to be for the Volo Showtape in Summer of 2025 before it was delayed into the next year.

## Trivia
- The show directly mentions the Homely for Christmas album released to ShowBiz Pizza Places in 1987, with Beach Bear reprising the song 'Please Come Home for Christmas'
- Beach Bear's segment is also one of the only known times the live recording of a song with their VA is shown alongside their animated character performance.
- The segment 'Daddy's Hands' is directly off the Shooter Jennings 2012 album 'Family Man', and is not rerecorded for the showtape.{{< cite 3 >}}
