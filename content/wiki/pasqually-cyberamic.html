The <b>Pasqually Cyberamic</b> is an animatronic figure created by Pizza Time Theatre Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre locations from 1979-1980's, and by other companies in the 1990's.
It is a pretty simple figure, having only 8 movements. The Pasqually Cyberamic would later be utilized in the Road Stage, 2-Stage, and 1-Stage shows as part of Munch's Make Believe Band.
