***Velas * Rock-afired Song by Coin Bros* is a single segment showtape produced for the *[Creative Engineering YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjhqAaWA7JZtxm3Mof3KJcA).*
The song was programmed due to Creative Engineering's previous collaboration with *Coin Bros* in Rock-afired for Coin - Sort It Out, though does not seem to be a direct collaboration this time.**
