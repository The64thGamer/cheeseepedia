<h3>File Dates</h3><ul><li>Studio C DVD: 3/08/07 9:51pm</li></ul>
<h3>Store Submitted Videos</h3><ul><li>In the January 19th, 2007 issue of Chuck E. Focus, an ad invited stores to submit videos for inclusion during the song 'You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine'. Cast members were to record videos of themselves lip-syncing to the song whilst doing their job. The deadline for submissions was February 12th, 2007. The final video seems to only include reused location footage from previous shows along with newly filmed footage of Munch.</li></ul>
