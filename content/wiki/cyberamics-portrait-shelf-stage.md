The ***Cyberamics* **Shelf Stage**** (known commonly as the ***Cyberamics Portrait Stage***) was a stage format installed at several {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} stores from 1979 to 1981. The stage would debut at the {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}} location at its grand opening in May 1979 as a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}} version of the {{< wiki-link "Winchester PTT Show" >}} &amp; {{< wiki-link "Kooser PTT Show" >}} and would go extinct in Fall 2001 at the {{< wiki-link "Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)" >}} store.

## History

### Pizza Time Theatre

The ***Cyberamics Shelf Stage*** was first created in May 1979 for the opening of the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}}. The stage was produced for all PTT's from 1979 to Mid 1980. In May or April 1980, {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} would introduce the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}(1) as a stage type on a platform instead of inside of the theatre's walls. The Portrait Stages would continue to be produced for location, though would either be on 1 wall, or be a Balcony &amp; Shelf Hybrid. The PTT on {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}} would be the first one to open with a Balcony Stage, &amp; after 1981, all future locations would be set to get a Balcony Stage instead of a Shelf Stage. The Last Shelf Stage to be produced was for the PTT on {{< wiki-link "Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)" >}} In June 1981, which had the normal 2-Wall Variant.

### Chuck E. Cheese's

By 1987, almost all Shelf stages had been removed, except for {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Tucson, AZ (5534 E 22nd St)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Ogden, UT (3155 Harrison Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Hayward, CA (24253 Hesperian Blvd)" >}}, &amp; {{< wiki-link "Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)" >}}. By 1990, almost all the remaining Shlef Stages had been removed except for {{< wiki-link "Ogden, UT (3155 Harrison Blvd)" >}} &amp; {{< wiki-link "Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)" >}}, with Ogden's being shut off making Lake Forest, CA's the last functioning one. Lake Forest's had also been modified into a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} &amp; Shelf Stage Hybrid with the stage looking more like a Late 1980 Shelf setup but with C-Stage decor, Making Ogden's the last full Portrait Show Remaining. sometime in 1991, {{< wiki-link "Ogden, UT (3155 Harrison Blvd)" >}} would close, Making Lake Forest the last location with a Shelf Stage. The Stage remained until 2001, when the location permanently closed.

## Design

The Cyberamic Shelf Stages, similar to the Kooser Shelf Stage, would be placed alongside one or two walls to draw attention to all characters. All characters in the center wall would be placed inside thin, beige portrait frames with a black outline inside it. The nameplates would be located on a wood trim below the characters with a 40-degree wall going upwards directly under the trim. Mr. Munch and Pasqually had their own unique frames, carrying over from the {{< wiki-link "Kooser PTT Show" >}}. The set up included doors that would open and close as per the show's programming. Similarly enough, the Warblettes also had a unique frame to make up for the size of the three birds within. The Flag Wavers, Pizza Time Orchestra, and Applause Board would be placed in various areas of the theatre, mainly near the characters. Later versions of the stage would ditch the portraits in favor for Balcony like design. The balcony-like variant would be the variant most later shelf locations received. It's unknown if any former portrait variant location got retrofitted to a balcony-like variant.
