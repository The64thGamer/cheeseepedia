## Production

### DBX Decodes

While most songs were DBX decoded due to the controller's lack of a need for a DBX box, some had this step accidentally
skipped, and sound worse as a result. Due to both channels being merged to fit the showtape format, alongside peaks in
the audio, attempts to decode the songs as they are won't be as fruitful.
