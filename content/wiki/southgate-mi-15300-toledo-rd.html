<h2>History</h2>
Southgate opened on June 17th, 1982 as the 1st ShowBiz Pizza Place in Michigan and as a corporate-owned store and was an expansion of the shopping center it was in. Southgate originally featured the Rock-afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. Southgate would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel / {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}}, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, adding Blue and White awnings above the salad bar, added checkers around inside and outside the store, and removing all SPP decor for CEC decor.
In around 1999/2000, Southgate would receive the another remodel which removed all older 90's decor, added newer decor, removed all checkers inside and outside of the store, and added SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. In 2006-2007, Southgate received the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing older decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, painting the walls purple, relocated the stage, and adding bright florescent lighting. Southgate would remain like this until August 2019 when they would receive the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel removing all older decor for newer decor, received a new game package, replaced booths, and removed the 3-Stage for a 2019 Model Dance Floor. Currently as of May 2023, Southgate still has the 2.0 Remodel and 2019 Model Dance Floor.
<h2>Stages</h2>
