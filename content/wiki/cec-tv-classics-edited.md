To Do:
This is the Canada version that changed some songs and removed the commercial jingles from the USA version. The show lineup of songs, & videos are from {{< wiki-link "SPP FriendsMomsTVThemes" >}} the counterpart showtape released around the same time frame. It is importantly the first showtape to have three original segments made for this show, and it will be the standard moving forward until {{< wiki-link "You're A Star" >}} in September 1993.
