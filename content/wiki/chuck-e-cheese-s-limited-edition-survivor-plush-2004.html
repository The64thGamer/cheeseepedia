<h3>December 11, 2002 Prototype</h3>
The December 2002 prototype, called Safari Chuck E. Cheese, featured both binoculars and butterfly net as opposed to having one or the other. The general appearance of the plush was retained until its eventual release in 2004.

<h2>Design</h2>
The plush-toy features Chuck E. Cheese in an safari inspired outfit, with beige clothing accented by his brown shoes and belt buckle. The hat for Chuck E. features holes for his ears to pop out of for viewing.
The butterfly net variant has long sleeve shirt, long pants, and a dragon fly inside of the net--as for the binocular variant minorly changing Chuck E.'s outfit to wear a short sleeve shirt and shorts. In rare cases the butterfly net variant would be paired with the binoculars much like the prototype.
