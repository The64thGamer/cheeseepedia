<h2>Production</h2>
This plush was a part of Dennis Foland Inc's first set of original Chuck E. Cheese plushies and was the first Pasqually plush produced by Dennis Foland Inc.
The 1996 set introduced putting wires and cardboard pieces into the plush's legs and feet to give them the ability to pose and to stand upright on flat surfaces.
<h3>Prototypes</h3>
A prototype plush can be seen in the 1997-1998 Merch Catalog.<sup>(1)</sup> Pictures of the plush show that this plush was originally going to have separate pieces for its eyebrows as apposed to the released plush having them printed on its eyes.

<h2>Design</h2>
The plush has a round body with two cylindrical legs connected to it. The plush has boxy arms with mitten-like hands. One arm of the plush tends to be significantly more understuffed than the other. The plush's head has a sunken in chin, a big round nose, two ears that look like a folded circle. It's two eyes are squares that are rounded out at the top with printed black details to represent his eyebrows and pupils. The plush's mustache is nicely shaped but is ruined by the fuzzy material used on the mustache and hair. A red mouth is featured under the mustache. The plush's shoes are nicely detailed with white and black fabric and blue ribbon shoelaces and his pants are black. He has a red striped shirt under his apron. His apron has been made smaller compared to the previously released 1992 and 1994 plushies to make room for his poseable legs. He has a sewn neckerchief that can be untied and removed. He also has a white chef's hat with the same red striped pattern on its brim as it was on his shirt.
