<h2>History </h2>
Mentor opened on July 20th, 1998. Mentor would be the second to last new store to open with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}} stage, as Studio C stages were being installed in stores by this point. Mentor opened with the 1993 remodel which included Record Posters and other decor, SkyTubes and Toddler Zone, and the 1-Stage. In 2006, Mentor received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} removing older decor for newer decor, removing Showroom Walls, removed Toddler Zone, relocated the 1-Stage, and relocated some parts of the store like the kitchen area, salad bar, some games and added newer games, booths, and tables. Mentor expanded in 2009 to fit in more games, booths, and tables. On May 13 2024, Mentor would begin its {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}
