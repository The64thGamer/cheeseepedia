<h2> Trivia: </h2><ul><li>While this show was to begin playing on September 1st, stores with Existing Stages wouldn't receive the show until after the 6th and those with Studio C/Weigl stages wouldn't get it until after the 13th. According to Matt Daniel, this was due to issues with the 3rd party agreement for the film <i>Free Birds</i> due to their in-store cross promotion not beginning until the 16th. There were also technical issues with the Studio C/Weigl version.</li><li>With the newsletter to this show had stores remove Chuck E.'s hat to update the animatronic show to look more accurate to the current design of Chuck.</li><li>Marvin The Tech Guru - 'Beards' was programmed for Studio C/ Weigl based stores and was part of segment 4 while it was an unprogrammed intermission for stores with Existing Stages. When it was reused for {{< wiki-link "April 2014 Show" >}}, it was an intermission for all stages and lacked the programming.</li></ul>
