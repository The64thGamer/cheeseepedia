***Farmingdale, NY (229 Broadhollow Rd./Rt. 110)*** was a *Nathan's Fun Zone* location that seemingly opened in the early 1990's, at earliest in 1993 per newspaper archives {{< cite 1 >}}. This location featured a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} until 2011 when the show was auctioned off {{< cite 2 >}}.

The show was known to run in poor condition, with little to no airflow and mismatched cosmetics, specifically on {{< wiki-link "Mitzi Mozzerella" >}}, who donned a "Fun Zone" t-shirt and was lacking her hair piece. However, based on the configurations of the {{< wiki-link "Hard Luck Bears" >}} shows at Gulliver's and the public shows that have opened since, the Classic Stage in this location was likely the last of its kind to be built to standard specification.

The location claimed to be remodeling based on a website post in early 2012, which can be corraborated with the removal of the show in 2011 {{< cite 3 >}}. A Facebook post in 2014 states that their website was being worked on {{< cite 4 >}}. However, the Facebook post also states that the location closed that same year, with little fanfare.
