## DVCAM Footage

The first full footage of the show will be provided by Brian Hagan on December 21, 2021.{{< cite 1 >}} This was through a DVCAM recording of the show video spliced with recordings of the {{< wiki-link "Studio C" >}} stage performing the showtape. This recording would additionally be AI upscaled.
The footage would be copyright-claimed minutes after upload, but was able to be downloaded before being pulled. The footage would be reuploaded multiple times with cut-down segments, but improved video clarity.{{< cite 2 >}}

## Trivia:

- This was the second version of Studio C Premiere created, the first being created in October 1997, with nothing known about its existence. Studio C originally lacked Bird, meaning it would have to be very different than what eventually came.
