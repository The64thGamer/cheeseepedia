***SPP Moms / TV Themes / Neighbors* is one of the last few showtapes released for *ShowBiz Pizza Place's* hosting the *Rock-afire Explosion*.
For some stores, this was the last tape used before *Concept Unification* would start at their location. Each tape sent after {{< wiki-link "SPP Christmas '89 Wave Bday" >}} would become increasingly more rare as stores would convert to *3-Stages.***
