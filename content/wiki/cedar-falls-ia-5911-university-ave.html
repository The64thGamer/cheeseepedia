<h2> History </h2>
Cedar Falls opened on August 1, 2001, with a Phase 3 remodel and {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}. Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Cedar Falls from this time. In 2006-2008, Cedar Falls received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved the removal of 90s decor, dim lighting, changed the exterior, and added purple walls. The Skytubes were removed some time afterwards. In late-August 2022, the location began 2.0, removing the Beta for a 2021 Model {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}. As of August 2023, Cedar Falls remains like this.
