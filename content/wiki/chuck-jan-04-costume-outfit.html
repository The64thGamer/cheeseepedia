The <b><i>Chuck Jan '04 Costume Outfit</b></i> is a costume outfit that appears in the {{< wiki-link "January 2004 Show" >}}.
It is the same style as the blue and yellow outfit seen in the {{< wiki-link "September 2003 Show" >}}. Both shirts are most likely early versions of what would become the 2003 Chuck E. Cheese outfit. The fur arms are attached to the shirt.
