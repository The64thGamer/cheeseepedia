***Birthday Extravaganza (ShowBiz Branded)*** was first released in July 1989 for ShowBiz Pizza Place locations with the Pizza Time Players. It would be available as a "Special" from the show panel until 1990, when it would be discontinued alongside the last show produced on reel, leaving {{< wiki-link "Birthday Extravaganza (Chuck E. Cheese Branded)" >}} as the only option. 

## Summary
Chuck E. Cheese states, "I've got an announcement to make, cause dis is a very special day!" leading to the rest of the group making their guesses, with Helen finally guessing, "Wait, I know! It must be someb-b-body's birthday!" The birthday cakes are then brought out for all the birthday guests. Chuck E. Cheese then talks about the special guests and their special day, followed by singing Happy Birthday to You. 
After blowing out their candles, the Pizza Time Players sing "We Just Wanna Say Happy Birthday to You," followed by the band singing "From Chuck E. Cheese, Where a Kid Can be a Kid!" Then Chuck E. Cheese and the rest of the Pizza Time Players let the special guest know the "Birthday Helpers" can help! Such as cleaning your table, carrying presents to your car, or even giving Munch pizza.
The performance ends with all of the Pizza Time Players shouting "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"
