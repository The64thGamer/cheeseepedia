<h2>History</h2>
This store opened on December 19th, 2001 with a Phase 3 Thumb Chuck logo over the door with the 'Chuck E. Cheese's' name directly below Chuck. The store opened with the classic Phase 3, featuring Must C TV's in the showroom, and props, posters, and magazines scattered throughout the store.
In 2008, the store exterior signage was replaced with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} thumb chuck signage. From then up until 2014, the store had slowly been removing pieces of art off the walls (Magazines, the Warhol pieces, props, etc.) A few months before the store's remodel, they were given purple walls in the showroom, and a the front counter area. By June 2018, the store  would begin its {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, removing the store's show by July 3rd.<sup>(1)</sup> The grand re-opening event at Lake Charles was held on August 9th, 2018, with athlete Jennie Finch attending.
