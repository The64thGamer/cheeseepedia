## History

American Pinball (a subsidiary of Orbit Games) began teasing a Rockafire Explosion-related announcement in November 2025. Roughly two weeks later, on December 3, 2025, they would reveal two images of the ShowBiz Price Place on Facebook.{{< cite 4 >}} That same day, Orbit Games' Facebook page would make another post outlining the machine's basic features and planned ship date. They also stated that it would appeal to both adults who remember {{ < wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" > }} and children whose familiarity with animatronics stems from newer media like {{ < wiki-link "Five Nights at Freddy's (Game)" "Five Nights at Freddy's" > }}.{{< cite 1 >}}
