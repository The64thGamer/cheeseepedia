<b><i>7448 Amador Valley Blvd, Store #322</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on August 1st, 1994 with a 1-Stage, which is still operating to this day with the 2.0 Refresh.
This is not to be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Dublin, CA (7590 Amador Valley Blvd)" >}} located in the same plaza that opened April 21st, 1982 and closed in December 1985 with the {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
Dublin opened on August 1st, 1994 in a freestanding building in an unnamed plaza on Amador Valley Blvd. The store opened with {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} of the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program. In around 2000-2001, Dublin would receive {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} which involved the addition of the Toddler Zone, and some other things. Dublin would remain this way until around 2011 which is when they received the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of Showroom Walls, 1990's d√©cor, Dim Lighting, adding an extra door to the Showroom, and the reconfiguration of the front counter (It is unknown if Dublin ever had Balcony Seating). In January 2024, Dublin started their {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, and removed their {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} shortly after starting. As of January 2024, Dublin is still undergoing their 2.0 Refresh.  As of March 2024, the store has since added the Trampoline Zone and Video Wall, and is currently in the process of installing the Dance Floor.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a 1-Stage, which also had a turntable, which they still have but not operational. When first installed, Chuck E had the Tuxedo & Derby outfit like all other 1-Stages and a functional turntable that turned when a Live or a Birthday Show played. Between 2009-2012, Pasqually's mask would be replaced. In 2018, Chuck's mask would be replaced with {{< wiki-link "Newark, CA (39839 Mowry School Rd)" >}}'s which got 2.0 in 2018. In March 2023, Jasper's mask would replaced with one from {{< wiki-link "Sun Valley, CA (8375 Laurel Canyon Blvd)" >}}, which possibly got a new Jasper mask or it could of been a spare one they had backstage. In January 2024, Dublin's 1-Stage was removed.
