## Trivia:

- All of the segments include newly recorded intros and outros as well as the Jukebox Jam logo.
- Munch, Jasper, and Pasqually are all voiced by Duncan Brannan for this show.
- 'Freeze Frame' has different footage in this show which is reused from July 1994.
- 'I Won't Give Up' is completely different from when it was originally used in March 1995. In this show it is the complete song with a line of dialogue by Chuck which was also not in the original show. The beginning of the footage shows part of a live show countdown, suggesting this may be a live show version of the song.
