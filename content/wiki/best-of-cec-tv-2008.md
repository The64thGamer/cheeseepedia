## Trivia

- The VJ spots in this show feature Matt Daniel. The VJ spot in Segment 5 is interesting as 'Going On A Diet', a cut song from {{< wiki-link "September 2004" >}}, can be heard in the background.
- Most of the songs in this show use single versions which don't include intro dialogue or the ending applause.
- A Generic Version of Best of 2008 with a different lineup is rumored to exist presumably it is the same lineup with the adverts removed.
