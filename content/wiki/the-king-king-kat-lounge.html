<b><i>The King / King Kat {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}</b></i> were animatronics of The King produced by {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} from June 1981 to 1983.
The bots were controlled using the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamic Control System" >}}. Some bots would be retrofitted from The King into King Kat from 1983 to 1985. The bots would be placed in a location's Lounge / Cabaret room<ref name=':0'>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/ptt/ptt_pizzatimes1-2.pdf</ref>.
<h2> History </h2>
The King cyberamics were designed by PTT Inc. as an animatronic version of The King in 1981. The bot's cosmetics were designed by Kathy Wolf & Jul Kamen<sup>(0)</sup>. The bot's original name would first be 'King Leon' before moving to 'The King'.<sup>(1)</sup>
The first King Cyberamic debuted at the Pinole, CA (1570 Fitzgerald Dr)|Pinole, CA store in June 1981<sup>(0)</sup>. The bot would be stationed in The Lounge section of the store. The animatronic slowly began one of PTT's highest manufactured bots, right behind the main stage Cyberamics. The last confirmed bot was installed at {{< wiki-link "Union, NJ (1660 US-22)" >}} in 1984. The Bots would be retrofitted to The King Kat bots during PTT's Financial troubles to try & get more income. The King bots started being removed from 1986-The Late 1990's when the last bots were removed by SPT.
<h2> Design </h2>
The King bots wore a white jumpsuit with silver lining and held a red guitar. The King Kat retrofits wore sunglasses, a curly afro hairstyle, a red-sequined jacket, a sequined glove, and held a microphone. (This also had the Strum and Fret hands removed.) The sunglasses were made out of Styrofoam making his pupils and animatronic eyes not visible.
<h2> Movements </h2>
The bot features 13 movements in total.
