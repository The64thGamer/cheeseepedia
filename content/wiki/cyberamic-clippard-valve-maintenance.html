Cyberamics manufactured by Pizza Time Theatre, Inc came with valves from <i>Clippard</i>, specifically the <b><i>Clippard EVO-3M-24 3-Way Elec. Valve.</b></i> Each animatronic has a pair of 8 valves on their board, identified by their bright yellow cap.
<h2> Purchasing New Valves </h2>
This valve, as of 2023, can be found for around $20-40 each from various venders and resellers.<sup>(1)</sup> Clippard is also still producing these valves and can be bought directly from them.<sup>(2)</sup>
<h2> Identifying Bad Valves </h2><ol><li>Connect the valves up to air and have 28 PSI of air going into the valves.</li><li>Track the wires of the valves you wish to test down to the bottom of the valve board and apply 24V DC to the valves.</li><li>If the valve is not making a clicking sound, it is most likely dead. However if the valve is releasing a small amount of air, or staying activated after power is removed, it may just be a clogged valve.</li></ol>
<h2> Valve Clogging </h2>
There’s two different reasons that could cause a valve to be clogged:<ol><li>The exhaust at the top of the valve isn’t able to release.</li><ol><li>Remove the muffler from the top of the valve.</li><li>Clean the inside with a cotton swab.</li></ol>
<li>The internals of the valve may be clogged.</li><ol><li>The valve will need to be opened. Twist the silver ring that goes around the valve to the left and hold the top of the valve in place.</li><li>Remove the thin silver ring and thin disc on the inside of the valve.</li><li>Clear the inside with a paper towel.</li><li>Place the silver ring back into the valve, followed by the disc. Make sure the bump on the bottom of the disc is facing down when reinstalling.</li><li>Close up the valve by tightly turning the ring to the right.</li></ol></ol>
If the valve is still releasing a small amount of air even after these fixes, then the valve is going bad, and will need to be replaced.
<h2> Replacing a Valve </h2><ol><li>The valve will need to be opened. Twist the silver ring that goes around the valve to the left and hold the top of the valve in place.</li><li>Remove the thin silver ring and thin disc on the inside of the valve. Hold onto them as they will be reused.</li><li>Clear the inside with a paper towel.</li><li>Follow the wires for the valve down to the bottom of the valve board and remove them.</li><li>Place the silver ring back into the valve, followed by the disc. Make sure the bump on the bottom of the disc is facing down when reinstalling.</li><li>Replace the old valve with the new one.</li><li>Close up the valve by tightly turning the ring to the right.</li><li>Solder the two wires to the board in place of where the old valve was.</li><li>Transfer the muffler from the old valve over to the new valve.</li></ol>
<h2> Replacing a Valve Seal </h2>
Sometimes near the bottom of a valve, the seal may go bad and begin to leak.<ol><li>The valve will need to be opened. Twist the silver ring that goes around the valve to the left and hold the top of the valve in place.</li><li>Remove the thin silver ring and thin disc on the inside of the valve. Hold onto them as they will be reused.</li><li>Clear the inside with a paper towel.</li><li>Unscrew the valve's mount. The mount may get stuck from years of use, so use one of the three holes as a grip to pry the mount out.</li><li>Use a thin tool to remove the rubber O-Ring from the bottom.</li><li>Replace the O-Ring with a new one. Most standard O-Ring kits come with the correct size needed.</li><li>Use an O-Ring lubricant to ensure the O-Ring does not get pinched against the manifold.</li><li>Screw the valve mount back in.</li><li>Place the silver ring back into the valve, followed by the disc. Make sure the bump on the bottom of the disc is facing down when reinstalling.</li><li>Close up the valve by tightly turning the ring to the right.</li></ol>
Run the valve with air to ensure the seal doesn't have any further leaks, and that the process was completed successfully.
