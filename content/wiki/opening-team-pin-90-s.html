The <b><i>Opening Team Pin (Avenger)</b></i> was given to CEC employees for being the first employees during a store's opening, to be worn on their lanyard.
<h2>Design</h2>
The design is a metal pin featuring Coach Chuck art. The bottom section of the pin says 'Opening Team', alongside a section for the name of the store. The store name seems to be white plastic embedded into the metal with the name pressed and printed into it.
