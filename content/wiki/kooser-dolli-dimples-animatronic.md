The ***Kooser Dolli Dimples Animatronic*** was an animatronic version of Dolli Dimples created by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} for {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} in 1978. The bot was used at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} from December 1978 to May 1980. The bot was made to only activate when a token was put in. The bot was controlled using the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamic Control System" >}} & {{< wiki-link "PTT Show Selector" >}} with the bot being programmed at Kooser using the {{< wiki-link "Big C's Cyberamics Center" >}}.

## History

### Manufacturing & Creation

The Kooser Dolli bot was created by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} in 1978 for a new experimental store location type, the Piano Bar Lounge, that would be implemented into the second Pizza Time Theatre on Kooser Rd. San Jose, California. The bot was programmed with the {{< wiki-link "Kooser Main Show & Dolli Showtape" >}}.

### In Store

The Kooser Dolli bot was installed in the Piano Bar Lounge at Kooser somewhere before it's opening in December 1978. The bot would become one of Kooser's & PTT's major selling points in the late 70's in which it would be called The 'Dolli Dimples Cabaret'{{< cite 1 >}}. The bot was briefly featured in a 1979 segment of Real People, in which she played the song "Talk to the Animals"{{< cite 2 >}}. Later in 1979, The Australian Broadcasting Commission show 'Four Corners' ran a segment called 'New Eatery Fad' {{< cite 3 >}} which, despite focusing mainly on the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} location, featured Dolli singing "Deep In the Heart of Texas." The bot would remain in the Cabaret until its removal in 1980.
.

### Modern Appearances

The bot appeared as a character in the 2018 CEC Halloween special 'Halloween At The Pizza Time Theater' in which the Animatronic appears alongside a {{< wiki-link "Guest Star / Helen Henny (Cyberamic)" >}} & {{< wiki-link "The King / King Kat (Lounge)" >}}. In the short, The Bot is given legs & attempts to attack {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese" >}} after he gives criticism to the 3 bots.

## Design

Dolli has curly red hair, a purple dress with embroidered flowers, a ruffled white collar, green eyes (described as "aqua"), {{< cite 4 >}} two front teeth, pink painted fingernails, and pink eyelids.
