- The Dog Days of Summer remix removes the backing vocals (except for Helen, who also sings some of Jasper's lines).
- The Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Song was re-recorded with all the backing vocals.
- Happy Birthday (Spanish) was re-recorded with the current US voice actors.
- Song of Summer (Concert Remix) has Jessi sing Bella's lines and also ends the song with a fade-in of the characters saying their goodbyes.
