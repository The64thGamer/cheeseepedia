The articulated Chuck E. walkaround head was created in 1996 by former Creative Engineering employee, David “Billy Bob” Irving.
<h2> History </h2>
The articulated walkaround heads were created by 'Billy Bob' Irving for ShowBiz Pizza Time to be used for on-screen appearances from 1996 to 1997.
For preparation of the Galaxy 5000 movie, the articulated head was refurbished by Billy Bob. In the  process the original eyelashes were replaced and he was given a red cap.
As of 2024, it is unknown of where the head or any other accompanying parts could be.
