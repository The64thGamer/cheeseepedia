## Production:
During production, demo versions of 'Silicon Valley Showdown',  'It's A Jungle Out There', and 'Walk Like an Egyptian' were recorded with vocals only featuring the voice of Steve White. On January 12, 2026, the demo recording for 'Silicon Valley Showdown' was uploaded to YouTube by user ’Rockafire Moon’ followed by 'Walk Like An Egyptian' on January 13th, these were ripped from a cassette tape found at the CEC corporate offices by Gabe (Pizzacam).
### Silicon Valley Showdown
At the beginning Steve White notes 'Okay, coming up next, Silicon Valley Showdown, subtitled 'Fastest Mouse in the West'. And this the idea is this would be something like a uh . It's a talk sing with a singing chorus' 'The lines during the introduction of Pasqually the Kid,  Wyatt Burp, and Helen Henny were changed. Wyatt's line '...I'm looking for a certain female name of Helen. Met her on email. Thought I'd take her back to my corral' was changed to '...I'm looking for a certain female name of Helen. Met her on email. Thought I'd like to log on for a chat', Pasqually's line '...You can just delete that file cause this is Helen here and she's my gal' was replaced by '...You can just delete that file this data base queen won't date a desert rat' Chuck's line was originally '...They looked at Helen, she sure was pretty, playing a piano programmed with MIDI, the kind of woman no can live without'. in the final mix was replaced with 'They looked at Helen, she sure was pretty, playing a piano programmed with MIDI, smart and sweet, uh that there was no doubt.{{< cite 1 >}}{{< cite 2 >}}
### Walk Like an Egyptian
At the beginning Steve White notes 'And now, in case I'm not completely embarrassed, let's try to sing along with Walk Like an Egyptian, shell we? Okay here, goes nothing. This and this is uh the lyrics from 11/10/95'. Once Steve White is done singing Walk Like an Egyptian he stated '...we might want to add additional uh there's 30 seconds currently on the uh note note also that I've added one additional fourline verse there more than on the original. Uh and finally that we might want to extend the instrumental outro to have Chuck E. do a talk over to encoutage kids in the theater to get up and walk like Egyptians'{{< cite 3 >}}
