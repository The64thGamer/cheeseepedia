***The Proposal / Automobile*** was a custom *Rock-afire Explosion* showtape made as a performance for a fan's marriage proposal. The fan, Tony, worked together with *Creative Engineering* to create the show, in which he would perform alongside pre-recorded lines from Billy Bob and Looney Bird about losing his engagement ring, before finding it and proposing to his then-girlfriend, Sam. This would be done during a tour of the Creative Engineering building on September 23, 2012, in which Sam agreed to Tony's proposal.

## Decision Tree

Unlike a standard showtape, each segment was part of a large decision tree. A website was made that had each decision link to a specific page, in which the segment's audio and signals would play automatically upon loading. Below is the original dialogue text to be acted out, unaltered. Green highlights marked the options officially picked during the show. Weirdly, in segment 4, option 1 happens, but afterwards is changed to then pick option 3, making the only moment in the decision tree where multiple options are selected.

Segment: Dialogue: Option 1: To: Option 2: To: Option 3: To: Option 4: To:

dult parties and kid parties. Bbob:You're right Looney..

Looney: Good idea Billybob
