<b><i>10850 Lincoln Trail, Store #916</b></i> is a <i>ShowBiz Pizza</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i>/<i>Chuck E.Cheese</i> that opened on May 23, 1984, with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.
<h2>History </h2>
Fairview Heights opened on May 23, 1984 as a test ShowBiz Pizza Place, being only 5,300 sq ft as opposed to the usual 10,000 sq ft, with the RAE stage. They later in the late 1980s received the 1988 remodel, which involved removing older decor for new decor, added checkers inside and outside the store, painted the walls, and added neon signage. In 1991/1992, Fairview Heights received Concept Unification, removing all ShowBiz decor for newer decor, and removed the RAE for the 3-Stage. Between 1994-1996, they received the 1990s Major Remodel with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} game package which involved renovating every aspect of the store. Between Winter 1997-Summer 2005, the 3-Stage was removed and replaced with Waukegan's 2-Stage, which for some reason was installed as a 1-Stage. They later received {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} game packages. In the late 2000s, they received the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, removed the dim lighting, renovated the exterior facade, and possibly expanded. Around 2019, they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the 1-Stage for a 2019 Model Dance Floor. As of July 2023, Fairview Heights remains like this.
<h2> Stages</h2>
At first, Fairview Heights had a RAE stage, as it was a ShowBiz at the time. Around when Concept Unification came around in 1991/1992, it was replaced by the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}. Between Winter 1997-Summer 2005, it was replaced by the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} from the {{< wiki-link "Waukegan, IL (2211 Grand Ave)" >}} store, which closed around the same time and was installed at Fairview Heights as a 1-Stage. In 2007, Chuck's tuxedo was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit and the Avenger hat. In Fall 2013, the Avenger hat was removed. Around 2019, the stage was removed for a 2019 Model Dance Floor.
