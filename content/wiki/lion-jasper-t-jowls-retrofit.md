***Lion*** (also known as ***The Lion***) was a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Jasper T Jowls (Cyberamic)" >}} used at the {{< wiki-link "Fun Zone &amp; Pizza" >}} on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}}. The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP.

## History

### As Jasper T. Jowls

The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 &amp; was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}.

### As The Lion

In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone &amp; Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Lion uses a generic [mascot costume](https://www.halloweencostumes.com/mascot-lion-costume.html) instead of the Jasper Cyberamic ones, though they still had the Cyberamics Cheese Guitar. The bot used Chuck E's lower half. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one. When Fun Zone &amp; Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
