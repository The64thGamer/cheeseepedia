## Trivia

- 'Stay Positive' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2021" >}}. "Together We've Got It" is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 1 2017" >}}, "My Family" is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 3 2019" >}}, 'It's the 70s' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 5 2017" >}}, 'Game On!' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 1 2020" >}}, and 'Billy & The Bully' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 7 2016" >}}.
- 'Billy & The Bully' normally has a unique title card saying **Chuck E. Cheese's Presents** which was seen when it used with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 7 2016" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 6 2017" >}}. For this current release it was removed.
- This was the first show not to include Birthday Live at Home following its introduction in {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2020" >}}. With the reintroduction of the Chuck E. Cheese walk-around in June 2021 after COVID-19 policies were loosened, stores began playing the recently reissued Birthday Star Spectacular again and the walk-around-less show became redundant.
