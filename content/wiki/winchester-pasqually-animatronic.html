<b><i>Winchester Pasqually</b></i> was an animatronic created by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} for the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} as an animatronic version of {{< wiki-link "Pasqually" >}}. The bot was controlled & programmed through the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Control System" >}} & {{< wiki-link "Winchester Hardware Setup" >}}.
The bot was used at Winchester from 1977 until it's replacement in 1981 when Winchester received {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Winchester </h3>
Pasqually debuted on May 17, 1977, along with the rest of the Winchester animatronics. Pasqually was originally going to call out pizza orders for pickup with the use of a microphone alongside his animated segments with the band. This was dropped early on, as too many orders were placed at a time, making it cumbersome to slowly call out each one. Pasqually was placed behind a set of doors, and would emerge from behind them, giving the illusion of popping out of the kitchen.
In 1978, Pasqually would be given a small copyright plaque on his frame, labeled '© Pizza Time Theatre Inc. 1978'.
<h3> Removal </h3>
In 1980, Pasqually, along with all the other animatronics, were removed from the location and replaced with the standard {{< wiki-link "Pasqually (Cyberamic)" >}} models. Pasqually was moved to the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}}, alongside the other retired Winchester animatronics. He would remain there until Pizza Time Theatre vacated the building following their bankruptcy in 1984. He would be saved along with {{< wiki-link "Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Winchester Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic)" >}} by Jul Kamen.
<h3> Corporate Move and Destruction </h3>
In the 1990's, CEC Entertainment borrowed the Winchester bots from Jul Kamen to use in a museum dedicated to CEC's history, the plans for which would never move forward. The bots were instead used as a display piece in the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}} until 2004.
At an unknown time during their stay at the office, the bots would be given different clothes and cosmetics. Pasqually would have all of his original clothing replaced with {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}} cosmetics, including the bot's latex hands, and the revised chef's toque.
In 2004, the building would undergo a remodel. The bots were removed as a result and ordered to be destroyed (rumored to be by Gene Cramm), as per CEC's de-identification policy. Jasper and Pasqually were destroyed, but Chuck E. Cheese was rescued by employees. Jul Kamen was not compensated for their destruction.
<h2> Design </h2>
This would be the first ever design for Pasqually. His attire and features were based around a stereotypical Italian pizza chef. His right hand holds a pizza cutter, while the other holds an uncut pizza. He is dressed in a red and white striped shirt, with a white apron and red neckerchief over it. His hat is a plain white chef's toque, sitting atop a head of curly hair.
His face brandishes a large fuzzy mustache, with an exaggerated lip and chin under it. His nose is spherical, pointing upwards from the mustache. His eyes are moved to the farthest upper corners of his face, with pupils looking down on the audience. His eyelids pose an extremely angry expression, with the left one slightly raised.
His hands are attached to the kitchen doors that can open and close, covering the animatronic in its entirety. This is designed to appear as if Pasqually is coming in and out of his kitchen. The doors have two fake windows and a large split sign reading 'Pasqually's Kitchen' over them.
In 1978 an additional copyright plaque labeled '© Pizza Time Theatre Inc. 1978' would be put on the bottom of his frame.
<h3> Corporate Adjustments </h3>
During his stay at the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}, most of his cosmetics would be changed to ones from the {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}} animatronic. This included his scarf, his mustache, his hat (being an updated hat from the first 3-Stage hat), his latex hands, and his apron. Additionally, his pupils would be moved from looking down-left to up-right, with stars painted across their surface. It is unclear if these were the original pupils, or replacement ones after the originals potentially falling off. It is unknown what was done with the old cosmetics after this change, though they were likely thrown away during refurbishment, or later during the remodel or move of the corporate office.
