The 1-Stage is a stage format found at Chuck E. Cheese's locations which either opened with the stage or replaced a previous stage from 1992 - 1998, 2011, and 2015. It was the last Munch's Make-Believe Band stage created, and the last Cyberamic stage created. As of January 2025, 6 1-Stages are remaining. 5 are in the United States, and 1 are in Chile.
<h2> Appearance </h2>
<h3> Mini Unit 1-Stage </h3>
The Mini Unit 1-Stage was the very first variation of the 1-Stage. It debuted at the Waldorf, Maryland location on March 24th, 1992. This stage version was specifically designed for a prototype 6,000 square-foot location CEC was testing for lower density areas, It was officially dubbed as a 'Mini Unit'. While it is mostly similar to the finalized design, the Mini Unit 1-Stage shares a few significant differences compared to the normal mass-produced 1-Stage design. It is the smallest 1-Stage design to date, with all the characters being crammed together. Pasqually's brick wall features a 'Pasqually's Amateur Hour Live' Logo, while the normal 1-Stages feature a blank brick wall. The Valence curtain is not present in this version, instead, it is a part of the wall and features rainbow lights on the right and left sides, with The Wink still being placed in the middle. The VHS Player was placed inside of Jasper's box, which made it easy for employees to switch out Showtapes for Live/Birthday Shows. Two more locations would open with the Mini Unit 1-Stage design. Columbus, Ohio (Soldano Boulevard) which opened on November 24th, 1992, and Lancaster, California which opened on March 8th, 1993. In 1994, two more Mini-Unit stores would open in El Paso, Texas, and Durham, North Carolina. While these two locations featured a small 1-Stage and the wall being a part of the valence, the wall valence would see slight alterations and the backdrops are that of the finalized version. Durham is currently the only location left to feature the Mini Unit design, as the other locations have closed/remodeled.

<h3> Staten Island Prototype 1-Stage </h3>
This design was only at the Staten Island, New York location, it featured a unique star behind Chuck E., 2-Stage buildings, a postcard with the Munch's Make Believe Band logo on it, and formerly featured a pull-out stage for live shows, but it was destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in fall 2012. Staten Island's stage was removed in July 2023 during the 2.0 remodel.
<h3> 1-Stage </h3>
The 1-Stage's general appearance is a city skyline with Chuck E. and Pasqually in front of faux brick walls. The buildings are more colorful and unique than previous iterations.
<h3> 1-Stage w/ Turntable </h3>
This version is the same as the normal 1-Stage, except that Chuck E. stands on a platform, this platform can turn when a live show happens, turning the Chuck E. bot into the backroom so the walkaround Chuck E. can come out, and also to not causing confusion as to why there were two Chuck E.'s. without the necessity to use curtains. There are currently 5 locations with the turntable left, and in all 5, they do not work anymore, except the Pearl City, Hawaii location has it turned to the back so the Chuck E. Bot is not visible.

<h3> 1-Stage w/ 2-Stage Backdrops </h3>
This stage is a regular 1-Stage, however opting for the 2-Stage's Backdrops. This variant of the 2-Stage is scaled around the same size as the Mini Unit 1-Stage. The reason as to why this exists is unknown.
