<b><i>1500 Almonesson Rd, Store #481</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese’s location located in Deptford, New Jersey; in The Court at Deptford shopping center. This location opened on November 12, 1991, and is still open to this day with a dance floor + video wall.
<h2> Stages </h2>
This location opened up with a Road Stage and was converted to a 1-stage sometime in 1994-1995. The 1-stage was different than normal 1-stages as it has the 2-stage props. Munch’s hat and the Munch’s Make Believe Band sign were both removed in May 2015. The sign was replaced with a flatscreen TV. In January 2016, the usual lights on the star were replaced with LED strips. Chuck E. received the Rockstar jeans in October 2019 and the Rockstar shirt in February/March 2020.
