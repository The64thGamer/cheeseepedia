***'Dancin' All Night Long'*** was a generic live show which was released alongside the {{< wiki-link "April 2009 Show" >}} and could be played through November 2010. 

## Summary

The live show begins with a pre-recorded announcement, meant to sound like a cast member speaking over the store intercom, telling guests to come to the showroom for a live show. Then the show announcer tells the audience to put their hands together for Chuck E. Cheese, which leads into the song. The footage is reused from 'Disco Inferno' from the {{< wiki-link "CEC TV April 2005 Show" >}} and 'Boogie Fever' from the {{< wiki-link "September 2003 Show" >}}.
