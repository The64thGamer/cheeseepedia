<b><i>2465 Centreville Rd, Store #368</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on
May 19, 1992, with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}, and is still open to this day with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
Herndon opened on May 19, 1992. At first, they had a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. Nothing special is known about it, and stayed up until the location received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} in 2005-2007, replacing the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}. It would remain this way until July 2023, when the location received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, meaning the Studio C was removed for a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} + {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}. The Avenger Chuck sign remained, but was replaced with a front with a green outfit. The location also received a Trampoline Zone. As of September 2023, Herndon remains like this.
