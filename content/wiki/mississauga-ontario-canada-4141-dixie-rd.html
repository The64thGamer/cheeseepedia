<b><i>Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in the Spring of 1991 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}.
<br>
This location had the last Road Stage, as well as being the <b>longest</b> operating Road Stage, after Topeka, Kansas, which received 2.0 in July 2022. The location is also the 10th location in Canada. It should not be confused with {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (2945 Argentia Rd)" >}} which opened on January 12th, 2006.
<h2>History</h2>
Mississauga (Dixie) opened its doors in Spring 1991 as the tenth Chuck E. Cheese store in Canada. it was also the 2nd and last franchised store in Canada. Fortunately, there is a ton of documentation of Mississauga (Dixie) back then. In the early-mid 90's, Mississauga (Dixie) underwent a minor remodel that removed a little decor for newer decor. Around the Late 90's, the location received the 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. On December 20th, 1998, the location was sold to corporate along with {{< wiki-link "Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave)" >}}, Wisconsin locations of {{< wiki-link "Milwaukee, WI (2701 S Chase Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "West Allis, WI (2990 South 108th Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Brookfield, WI (19125 W Blue Mound Rd)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Amherst, NY (4994 Harlem Rd)" >}}. Mississauga (Dixie) would remain like this until 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 remodel, however this would only be on the exterior until 2008 when they updated the interior, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing the Late 90's and early 2000's decor for newer decor.
<br>
On February 8th of 2025, it would be announced the location would become the sixth of the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}, due to it being the last Road Stage, and that CEC Corporate wanted to keep an animatronics stage in Canada.<sup>(1)(2)(3)</sup> Currently, as of February of 2025, the location still has the 2005 remodel and the last Road Stage along with the last banjo for Jasper at a location. On May 27th, 2025, it was announced that the stage would be moved to {{< wiki-link "Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave)" >}} after corporate deemed Mississauga's bots to be unsalvageable. It was taken out on June 15th, 2025.<sup>(4)<sup>
