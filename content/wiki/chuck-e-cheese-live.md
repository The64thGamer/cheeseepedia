- This live show had a countdown unlike many live shows from the early 90s.
- The countdown started with Chuck E. telling kids to find a place to sit and please stay seated during the performance. After that would be the 2 minute countdown with the spinning numbers and repeating backdrop while the song If [I'm Dreamin' (Don't Wake Me)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Run) played. After this the live show would begin.
