## Summary
Before Chuck E. Cheese Live, Chuck E. Cheese starts calling all the kids, letting them know the performance will begin in just 2 minutes. The remainder of the announcement tells those who are to view it not to be in the way of Chuck E. A two-minute countdown then begins with the song If I'm Dreamin' (Don't Wake Me) playing in the background. The song fades out with an announcer stating, "Ladies & Gentlemen, Boys & Girls. Welcome to ShowBiz Pizza Time. Starting the Pizza Time Players," The warbelettes begin introducing Chuck E. Cheese, it then goes on to an introduction of Chuck E. Cheese, Mr. Munch, Pasqually, Helen Henny, and lastly Jasper T. Jowls. It ends with the Pizza Time Players singing together, welcoming you to Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese thanks the folks in the audience and is not able to wait to "mingle" with them. The Pizza Time Players then perform "What's the Matter With Kids Today" from Bye Bye Birdie while Chuck E. Cheese insults the rest of the players. After singing "What's the Matter With Kids Today," Chuck E. Cheese sings Yankee Doodle, You're A Grand Old Flag, and Born in the USA.
