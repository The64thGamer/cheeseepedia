## Trivia:

- 'Be Yourself' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 4 2019" >}} and I Didn't Need to be Afraid is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 6 2018" >}}.
- Most stores were not using the Chuck E. walkaround due to precautions against COVID-19. As a compromise, 'Boo-Tastic Dance' was the first live show to have Chuck E. programmed for the animatronic stage shows.
- This was the first showtape released after Chuck E. Cheese declared bankruptcy for the second time.
