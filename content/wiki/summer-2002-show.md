## Production

#### Studio C Floppy:

This show's floppy disk for Studio C removed footage of the World Trade Center from 'America' in Segment 2, as the {{< wiki-link "Summertime 2001" >}} DVDs were used. When inserting the upgrade floppy, a message would appear on the screen saying
" SUMMER 2002 SHOW UPDATE FINISHED
 VALID JULY & AUGUST 2002 ONLY!!!!
 THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK, KEEP ON MAKING MAGIC!
 REMOVE FLOPPY DISK AND REBOOT THE COMPUTER"

## Trivia:

- 'Rockin' Christmas Eve' and 'America '99' both appear on the Studio C DVDs but could not be played.
