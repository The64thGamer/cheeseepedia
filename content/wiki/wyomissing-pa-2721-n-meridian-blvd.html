<b><i>2721 North Meridian Blvd, Store #539</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened on December 20th, 2000, as a corporate owned <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} and closed on September 15, 2024 after nearly 24 years of operation. It was located right across from the Broadcasting Square Shopping Mall.
When this store first opened, it opened with the 1998 C Cap logo and signage. It also opened with the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} (Phase 3), the remodel initiative for Chuck E. Cheese's locations at the time, consisting of 1991 - 1999 d√©cor.
<h2> History </h2>
Wyomissing first opened as a freestanding building near the Broadcasting Square Shopping Mall in December 2000. The store debuted with the Studio C Alpha, featuring a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic)" >}} animatronic and prop characters. This location did not receive any newer remodel during its almost 24 year run, but between October 2011 and November 2015, the awnings and 'Chuck E. Cheese's' lettering were replaced. Between December 2016 and September 2017, the 1998 C Cap sign was replaced with the 2015 Waving Rockstar Chuck sign, completing this store's modern exterior remodel.
The interior would see an update probably around that time too. This would not impact the interior of the store, wall art wise. All of the gameroom and showroom walls were painted yellow, green, orange, and blue, which were the same wall colors from the 2015 update (Phase 5). Interestingly, all of the Phase 3 wall decor (Must C TV award posters, Andy Warhol pop art posters, and Sports and Parody posters, Postcard posters, etc.) weren't removed during this remodel. This made the Wyomissing store half Phase 3 and half Phase 5. They would stay this way up to 2024.
Unfortunately, Wyomissing closed permanently on September 15, 2024 due to leasing issues. A picture online showed that a letter from CEC Entertainment was given to an employee informing of the store's closure.<sup>(1)</sup> Originally, there was discussion between CEC and the leasing company about the Wyomissing location being relocated, so the store's former 2.0 remodel plans were postponed indefinitely until the discussion was sorted out. Unfortunately, it's likely these plans were dropped due to the store's permanent closure.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Wyomissing opened with the Studio C Alpha stage. Their Studio C Alpha stage changed since the 2000s though. The outfit on the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic was likely the late night outfit when this store first debuted, and was replaced with the later Cool and Avenger outfit later in the 2000s and in the early 2010s. The Bird and Pizza Phone prop bots were removed from the stage between May 2022 and 2023. The apple TV on Chuck E.'s desk was red before store closure, but it's unknown if it was always like that.
