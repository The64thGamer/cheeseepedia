The <b>Clapper Board</b> or <b>Applause Board</b> is a board with many different animal paws that would clap and cheer after a show at Pizza Time Theatre. This includes an elephant trunk and hooves, duck feet on 1982-1983 models, frog feet on 1981 models, horse hooves, and dog paws. The Clapper Board was on the wall beside Pasqually on the Shelf, Balcony, Rocker, and C-Stage|C-Stages. The last Clapper Board was at either the Lake Forest, California, or Simi Valley, California locations. As of 2024, only three clapper boards are known to remain in public, at Enchanted Forest Water Safari, next to Rocky and the Ramblinâ€™ Rascals, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, and Smitty's Super Service Station. Except for the board at Smitty's which is fully functional, they are simply props and do not move.
