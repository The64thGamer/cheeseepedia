It opened with the 1992 update of the 1988 remodel which has checkers around the store, the Blue and White awnings, ad some Record Posters and decor. The store would receive its first remodel around the Late 1990's which included the removal of the Ball Crawl for the Sky Tubes and the changing of the exterior logo.

In around the Late 2000s-Early 2010s, a few elements from the 2005 update were removed which included the Dinner Lights and the sign above Kid Check. In 2013/2014, Brick replaced their exterior sign with the Rockstar logo. The store's exterior was remodeled in 2015 when the Brick Plaza Shopping Center underwent a major remodel. Sometime around May 2024, the store would receive its {{- wiki-link "CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" -}}, removing the stage for a {{- wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" -}} and {{- wiki-link "Video Wall" -}}.
