<b><i>The Singing Flowers</b></i> were prop characters at <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> restaurants. They were designed to replace the {{< wiki-link "Warblettes (Cyberamic)" >}} when a <i>Balcony Stage</i> was converted to a <i>Rocker</i> or <i>C Stage</i>. They were very simple characters with only a single mouth lever inside them. They would use the same bit as the Warblettes Mouth and this allowed the Warblettes to still function on stages that still had them.
<i>The Singing Flowers</i> were phased out during the introduction of the <i>Road, 1 and 2 Stages</i>. They were still programmed throughout the 90's and until 1999-2001, as corporate had a set installed on their <i>Road Stage</i>. They likely went extinct around then as photos of <i>Rocker Stages</i> in the late 90s and 2000's do not have them anymore. Some stages seemed to never even have these installed at all.
