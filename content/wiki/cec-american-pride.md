## Trivia:

- The intermission music is the same as {{< wiki-link "SPP Best Of 4" >}}.
- The first show to introduce the CEC-TV Specials (Geography Rap, Helen Henny's Hollywood, CEC-TV News), all of them except this specific CEC-TV News which doesn't get reused in future shows.
- This show introduced a brand new Helen Henny walkaround costume.
- This showtape marks the first time different shows were sent out to international locations, as the single Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza location in Canada (at the time) played the CEC TV Classics '91 show instead.
