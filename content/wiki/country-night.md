***Country Night* is a Rock-afire Explosion showtape released in ShowBiz Pizza Place locations in June 1983.**

## Potential Revision

An "Appearing Now" insert card containing most of the segments of the show would be found. This card however contains the segments "Banana Hill" and "Roast Beef Sandwich and a Pizza". For locations that would recieve a Klunk the next month, the {{< wiki-link "Uncle Klunk Showtape" >}} would contain both of these songs. It is not clear if this card is intended for this tape however.
