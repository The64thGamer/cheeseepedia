<h2> History </h2>

The Chuck E. Cheese in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, opened on October 21, 2002, within the Stones River Mall (now Stones River Town Centre). The store initially featured the 2000 remodel design and underwent the 2004 remodel in the late 2000s. It originally opened with a Studio C Beta stage. In 2013, the stage was relocated to a different wall. On November 17, 2022, the metal framing of the Studio C TV screens was removed, revealing the wall where the stage had been moved, the new setup was 4 TVâ€™s in front of a white wall. In May 2023, the store began its 2.0 remodel process, which was completed in August. This process started with the removal of artwork and the painting of the walls white. On June 3rd, the Studio C Beta stage and all the remaining artwork were sent to the SPT Distribution Center in Shawnee County, Kansas. The grand reopening of the remodeled store was held on August 20th. (More info will be added shortly!)
