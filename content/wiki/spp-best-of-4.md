***SPP Best Of 4 / Wave Bday* is one of the last few showtapes released for *ShowBiz Pizza Place's*
hosting the *Rock-afire Explosion*, being released on April 24, 1991. For some stores, this was the last tape used before *Concept Unification* would start at their location. Each tape
sent after {{< wiki-link "SPP Christmas '89 Wave Bday" >}} would become
increasingly more rare as stores would convert to *3-Stages.*
Despite the later years of *Cyberstar* being mostly re-used segments from earlier showtapes, the last showtapes
became the 'Best of' series, bringing back every single *Cyberstar* segment for stores to have. It was said at
this time that due to the *Rock-afire Explosion* being phased out, stores could play whatever showtapes they
had without sticking to the most recent show. The *Best of* series could be seen as an encouragement of this.**
