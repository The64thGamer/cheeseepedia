## Production
During production, demo versions of each song were recorded with different instrumentals and featuring the voices of Jeff Cosco and Kathy Turner. The lyrics for each song were mostly finalized by this point, with only a few differences, such as 'Don't Drive Me Wacky' being named 'Don't Drive Me Crazy'. On December 30, 2025, these demo recordings were uploaded to YouTube by user 'thetrapinquestion', which was ripped from a cassette tape found at the CEC corporate offices by Gabe (Pizzacam) {{< cite 2 >}}. The contents on the cassette are as follows.

- 'It's The Chuck E. Cheese Totally Awesome Kids Show' Intro and Exit vocal.
