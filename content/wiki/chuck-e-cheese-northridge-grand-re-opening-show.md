## Trivia

- This would be the first showtape to have curtains officially programmed since the {{< wiki-link "September 2005 Show" >}}.
- At 7:50pm a countdown would start reading 'Show Starts In' with a 10 minute countdown. Once finished playing, Together We've Got It 2017 would play.
- According to Logan Carreiro (Chief Animatronics Officer), before the event officially began, Segment 1 from the {{< wiki-link "SPP Concept Unification Premiere" >}} played on the stage. This is most likely false as this would require custom programming to make work.
