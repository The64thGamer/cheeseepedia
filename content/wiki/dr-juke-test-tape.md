The ***Dr. Juke Test Tape* was an unreleased showtape testing the {{< wiki-link "Dr Juke" >}} show selector concept.
The tape was the only of its kind using the {{< wiki-link "CEI LaserDisc" >}} format, where during the showtape segments the video contained PCM adaptor audio for the showtapes, and the LaserDisc audio tracks contained show control data.
Similar to what would become {{< wiki-link "Studio C" >}} showtapes, programs outside the segments were placed on the disc, allowing software to control animated segments while a show was waiting to be selected.**
