<b><i>Leominster, MA (132 Sacks Blvd)</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that open on January 15, 2005 with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}, and closed in June 2020 (day unknown).
This location is notable for a video posted on February 12, 2023 by the YouTube channel Urbax Vibes where they visited the Leominster location after closure to find most games still left behind inside, including the Chuck E. Cheese thumbs up exterior sign.
<h2> History </h2>
The Mall at Whitney Field originally opened in 1967 as the Searstown Mall. Not much is known about the space CEC would eventually be in, but in 1997, it was a Chapadelaine Auto Annex.<sup>(1)</sup> The mall would be renamed in 2004, one year before CEC opened.
The location opened on January 15th, 2005. They would have a Studio C Cappa V2, composing of three TVs, a bluescreen, and a 16M Chuck E. Cheese animatronic. This location opened with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} exterior, but still retained the 1990s design implemented by the SPT 1992 Remodel. The store would eventually remodel and expand in 2011. The location would remain the same afterwards until permanently closing sometime in June 2020. The exact date is currently unknown. All windows in the store would be covered up to prevent people from looking inside. Shockingly, most of the arcade games and attractions formerly at the store were left inside, including the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}. The stage would be left behind, though the bluescreen, three TVs, and most bot cosmetics were removed. Leominster's animatronic head would later be sent to the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania location to replace their 32M head. Pittsburgh's original head would be scrapped.
As of September 2023, the former tenant is still vacant. The exterior has been repainted over time, but a slight fade of the Chuck E. Cheese's logo label scar remains along with holes where the CEC letters were attached.
<h2> Stages </h2>
As stated before, Leominster had the second generation Studio C Cappa. Leominster's Chuck E. bot originally featured the Cool Chuck outfit. They would later receive the Avenger outfit by 2011. Sometime between 2018-2019, the top half of the bot would be replaced with the half from Rochester, NY (Ridge). Leominster would keep the Cappa until they closed. The Cappa would be demolished during closure, with the bot's head going to the Pittsburgh, PA store.
