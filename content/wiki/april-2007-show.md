## Production

### File Dates

- Studio C DVD: 3/08/07 9:51pm

### Store Submitted Videos

- In the January 19th, 2007 issue of Chuck E. Focus, an ad invited stores to submit videos for inclusion during the song 'You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine'. Cast members were to record videos of themselves lip-syncing to the song whilst doing their job. The deadline for submissions was February 12th, 2007. The final video seems to only include reused location footage from previous shows along with newly filmed footage of Munch.

### Filming Locations

- Everything not on location is shot at [MPS Studios](https://www.mpsfilm.com/).
- 'Listen To The Music' was filmed at the Granada Movie Theater in Dallas, Texas.
- China Grove is shot in the downtown area of Dallas, Texas.

## Trivia:

- Rob Gotcher and Michael Hill are seen working at the Movie Theatre in 'Listen To The Music'
- The Studio C puppets remain on-screen during 'Is It Love'.
