The <b><i>Chuck E. Cheese Metaverse</b></i> (Also called the <b><i>Chuck E. Verse)</b></i> was a cancelled plan in 2022 for a metaverse application, which could appear on mobile, PC, or VR devices.
<h2> Description </h2>
Through its trademark filings, the concept centers around a virtual Chuck E. Cheese restaurant, in which all aspects of a standard store are recreated for a virtual experience. These experiences will be shared between guests, as the metaverse term is used to describe highly social 3D software applications and games. Customers will be able to purchase virtual and physical goods, with the mention of food delivery given. This was already covered by their side-company {{< wiki-link "Pasqually's Pizza & Wings" >}}, in which you can order food made inside Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants, which is already available on delivery apps. Alongside this, mention of virtual arcade games, videos, programs, and virtual toys are purchasable.
A notable point in the description is the reference to 'actual and virtual concerts', theatrical performances and other virtual events'. With the company's slow departure from its animatronic shows at the time, along with the rapid need for online spaces by customers and the company's bankruptcy following the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, this may have been an attempt to bring its entertainment department fully virtual. With its characters and showtapes  evolving to virtual events and concerts in their roadmap.
