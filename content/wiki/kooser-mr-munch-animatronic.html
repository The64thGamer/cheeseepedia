<b><i>Kooser Mr. Munch</b></i> is an animatronic seen at the opening of the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} Pizza Time Theater. He would be used until Kooser upgraded to the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} in May 1980.
<h2> History </h2>
After Kooser replaced their Portrait Show with the Balcony Stage, Munch and the other Portrait Bots, aside from {{< wiki-link "Kooser Chuck E Cheese (Animatronic)" >}}, which we have confirmation of, were presumably sent to Sunnyvale. After PTT vacated the building due to bankruptcy, Munch would, along with the rest of Kooser's animatronics would be considered lost, as none of their fates have been learned, although the most likely option is they were thrown away.
<h2> Design </h2>
Kooser Munch is a purple monster animatronic that is covered in thick purple fur aside from his yellow stomach, eyebrows, and hair. He has pink eyelids over black eyes, as opposed to the regular eyes Kooser bots had. His arms were attached to two doors that would open when Munch was needed for the show, similar to both versions of Pasqually.
