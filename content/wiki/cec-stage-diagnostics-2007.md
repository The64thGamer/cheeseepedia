**CEC-Stage Diagnostics 2007** was a rerelease of {{< wiki-link "CEC-Stage Diagnostic Tape 1993" >}} on DVD. The diagnostics were initially included with all 3-Stage DVDs, but became their own disc in January 2007. This disc would be rereleased many times with multiple different covers until 2023 when all US CEC-Stage stores converted from DVD to Navori, which had diagnostics uploaded digitally. The last store to use this disc was {{< wiki-link "Lo Barnechea (Cantagallo), Chile" >}}.

## Diagnostics List:

Movements for the characters are repeated 15 times. Lights done once. Turn Table done 4 times. Curtains done 5 times.
