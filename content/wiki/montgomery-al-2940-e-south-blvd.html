<b><i>Montgomery, AL (2940 E South Blvd), Store #608</b></i> was a <i>Showbiz Pizza Place</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> which opened on September 30, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion, and closed in August 2013 with the 3-Stage.
<h2>History</h2>
Montgomery opened its doors on September 30th, 1982 as the fourth Showbiz Pizza store in Alabama with the Rock-Afire Explosion show like every other Showbiz Pizza. It was originally a corporate-owned location. In 1988-1989, Montgomery received the 1988 remodel removing the older SPP decor, adding newer decor, received a new exterior change, and updated the Billy Bob stage. In 1991, Montgomery received a major remodel, adding checkers around the wall, added Blue and White Awnings, and added more decor and removed some older decor, and received Concept Unification removing the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage. Montgomery received a minor remodel in the Mid/Late-90's removing older CU decor for the Record Posters, and removing the ball pits in favor of the SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. They would later remove the Showroom Walls and Balcony Seating. Montgomery would remain like this until August 2013 when they would relocate to the Montgomery, AL (1116 Eastdale Mall)|1116 Eastdale Mall location which is about 16 minutes away from here and opened with a Circles of Light stage. After its closure, the location became abandoned until in 2016 or 2017 when it would become a Bombay Lounge. That didn't last long as it closed around 2021.
Currently, as of March 2023, the location is now abandoned again. It is unknown if the building is going to be demolished.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, Montgomery featured a Rock-afire Explosion, as all other Showbiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-afire Explosion into the 3-Stage.
Montgomery would have the 3-Stage until August 2013 when the stage would be removed due to the store relocating.
