The bluescreen was removed in 2014, and the interactive console was removed in early 2015. The Apple TV was removed in 2018, due to the CRT TV not working. The gemini was replaced with a different light after it stopped working in 2019. Curtains were disabled in late 2016. The stage was removed on August 25th, 2024 and replaced with a video wall and dance floor.
