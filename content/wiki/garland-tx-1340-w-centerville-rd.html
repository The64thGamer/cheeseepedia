<b><i>1340 W Centerville Rd, Store #942</b></i> also known as <b></b>Centerville<b></b> is a <i>ShowBiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on November 3, 1982 as a corporate <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}.
<h2>History</h2>
Garland opened its doors on November 3rd, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although very little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Garland was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Garland received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade.
In 1991, Garland received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Garland received either {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} or {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} remodel which removed some early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. In around 1999-2000, Garland received the Phase 3 remodel which removed the 3-Stage for the Studio C Alpha. Garland remained this way until sometime in 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 Remodel which involved removing the Showroom Walls, balcony Seating, received a new exterior, expanding the store, and also removing some older 90's decor. In April 2015, the store received the Phase 5 remodel which removed all {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} artwork. In November 2021, they received the 2.0 remodel removing the Alpha for the Dance Floor. Currently, as of January 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and dance floor.
