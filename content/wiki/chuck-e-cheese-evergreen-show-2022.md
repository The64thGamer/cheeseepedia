## Trivia:

- This is the first domestic show to use the Evergreen format in which the same generic show would run in between seasonal and promotional events.
- 'Chuck E.'s Middle Name' and 'Crochet All Day' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2021" >}}, 'Dream Big' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 5 2016" >}}, 'Play All You Can Play' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 3 2019" >}}, 'Jasper's Country Classic' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 3 2018" >}}, 'Keep Drummin'' is originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 1 2016" >}}, 'Barbara the Barnyard Barber' and 'El Rey Guitarrista' are originally from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2020" >}}.
- The Studio C Programming for Keep Drummin' was redone but only for the Animatronic. The programming was changed & added the gemini for Pasqually's Drumo solo all other lighting was kept the same from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 1 2016" >}}.
- Several parts of this show are reused from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2021" >}} Such as the Skits 'Jasper's Country Classic', 'Crochet All Day', 'Chuck E.'s Middle Name' and 'El Rey Guitarrista' along with that three intermissions were reused from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2021" >}} those being Danny "Tricycle", Ants Ants Ants "Pinwheel" and No School Today "Marsupial"
- All Live show countdowns have been reduced from 7 minutes to 5 minutes.
- This was the last show to include Birthday Live at Home following its introduction in {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Show 2 2020" >}}. With the reintroduction of the Chuck E. Cheese walk-around in June 2021 after COVID-19 policies were loosened, stores began playing the recently reissued Birthday Star Spectacular again and the walk-around-less show became redundant. It would be removed from circulation beginning with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese Springtastic Show 2022" >}} as would it when Evergreen Show 2022 was {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese Evergreen Show 2022 (April Update)" >}} in April.
