It was originally a franchised-owned store. They would later end up receiving the [[CEC 1988 Remodel|1988 Remodel]] removing the old Showbiz decor, and adding newer decor. In 1991, Chattanooga received Concept Unification which removed the Rock-Afire for the 3-Stage and removed all Showbiz decor, added new decor, and a change to the exterior. Chattanooga was then bought by the corporate on September 16, 1996 along with 18 other locations. Chattanooga underwent another remodel in the Mid 90's which involved the removal of the Neon Signage, Blue and White Awnings, some checkers around the store and another exterior change.
