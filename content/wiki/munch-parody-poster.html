<b>MUNCH</b> was a poster created for ShowBiz Pizza and Chuck E Cheese's in 1988.
<h2>History</h2>
This poster was one of the many Chuck E Cheese's parody posters released in 1988. It is believed that after 1991, production of this poster and the other Chuck E Cheese's movie parody posters would cease.
Over the years, this poster would become very rare to find in stores nationwide as remodels would occur and the removal of this poster and rest of the movie parody posters. It's unknown what location in the United States was the last one to feature this poster in store. However the Guatemala City location did have this poster until it's closure in 2016. It's also  unknown if Guatemala City carried over their poster over to their relocation store along side a few record posters.
<h2>Design</h2>
The poster is a parody of the 1975 film, Jaws, with Mr. Munch as Bruce the shark and a pizza on top of the water as the swimming lady in the original poster. On the top of logo for the poster there's a quote that reads 'Just when you thought it was safe to go out for pizza'. This quote was only for this poster has no referenced to the original Jaws poster.
