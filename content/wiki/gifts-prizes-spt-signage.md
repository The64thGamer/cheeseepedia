The ‘Gifts & Prizes’ sign was put into stores around 1993 during the 1993 Update of 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program along with similar looking signs like the ‘Salad Bar’ and ‘Beverages’

## Appearance

The art showed a green present with a yellow riboon. The riboon line was 2D and part of the sign, but the riboon was 3D, separate from the sign but bolted to it. Under the present there was a streak that said ‘Gifts’, and under the streak there was another streak that said ‘& Prizes’. Both texts were colored in red and orange.

## Dimensions

Unknown. Sign is small.
