## Trivia:

- Despite having a live show called 'Spanish Birthday 2016', CEC never produced a Spanish version of Birthday 2016.
- After two years, a CEC TV Bumper (singing animals bumper) was once again put into the show after 'Escapade'. It depicts three animals singing 'Ba ba dum, C, E, C, TV' with a newly edited CEC TV logo in the corner featuring Rockstar Chuck's head.
- Pasqually's puppet was redesigned, and the Munch puppet received updates.
- During the run of this show, CEC uploaded footage of the animatronics at their corporate office singing the songs.
