<b><i>8943 University Avenue</b></i> is a Chuck E Cheese that opened on August 9th 1999 with a 32M Studio C Alpha. This location received the 2.0 remodel in June of 2021. The location is still open to this day.
<h2>History</h2>
This location was originally a <b><i>Chuck E Cheese's Pizza Time Theater</b></i> that opened in June of 1982 with a Balcony Stage, but this location would close in 1988 due to unknown reasons. This location would reopen as a Circus Pizza with a Rock-Afire Explosion in 1988. CEC would buy Circus Pizza in 1999 and resulted in it closing and becoming a Chuck E Cheese's.
<h2>Stages</h2>
In June of 2021, this location would replaced their Studio C Alpha with a Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of December 2024 Blaine remains with a 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall.
