The Blaine Chuck E Cheese opened on August 9th 1999 with a 32M Studio C Alpha. Before it was a Chuck E Cheese, It was a place called Circus Pizza, Circus Pizza had a Rockafire Explosion, But CEC bought Circus Pizza, so it was replaced with Chuck E Cheese. The bots were probably destroyed except Beach Bear which was saved by a private collector.
