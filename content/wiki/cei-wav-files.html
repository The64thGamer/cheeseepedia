<b><i>CEI .wav Files</b></i> are .wav files that contain usually between 4 - 6 tracks of audio and {{< wiki-link "Data" >}}.
These files can also be in other formats such as .wma and .wmv for videos. These are then played through a 5.1 channel USB sound card which connects to some speakers and either a {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion Control System" >}} or a {{< wiki-link "Layton Bit Stripper" >}}. The Showtape Audio is also DBX Decoded meaning you don't need a DBX Decoding Box. You will require a waveshaper to use the showtape with a Grey Box or a Layton Bitstripper.
<h2> Formats </h2>
Files are formatted two different ways, one with four tracks of audio, and one with six tracks of audio. The formatting for the 4-track .wav is as follows:<ol><li>Track #1 contains the show audio. If the track is stereo, it will be the left channel.</li><li>Track #2  contains the show audio. If the track is stereo, it will be the right channel.</li><li>Track #3 contains the {{< wiki-link "Pianocorder Data Format" >}} {{< wiki-link "Biphase Mark Code" >}}. This usually contains the Top Drawer Data for the show.</li><li>Track #4 contains the {{< wiki-link "Pianocorder Data Format" >}} {{< wiki-link "Biphase Mark Code" >}}. This usually contains the Bottom Drawer Data for the show.</li></ol>
The format for a 6 track .wav file is similar to the 4-track .wav. In this format, the contents usually in tracks 3-4 are placed in tracks 5-6, while 3-4 remain unused and silent.
