The **Soccer (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Soccer (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a team USA uniform from the World Cup with him holding a soccer ball.
