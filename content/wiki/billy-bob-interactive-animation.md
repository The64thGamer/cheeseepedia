***Billy Bob Interactive Animation*** (also just known as ***Interactive Animation***) was a control system developed in 1984 by ShowBiz Pizza Place for the {{< wiki-link "Billy Bob (Animatronic)" >}} that allowed an operator to control the character live to interact with guests.

## History
Footage from January 23rd, 1987 at the {{< wiki-link "Dallas, TX (13125 Montfort Dr)" >}} location, home to the initial training video, has a brief segment where the Fatz animatronic interrupts the middle of a birthday show (that continues to keep playing) and saying a few things before going back to being dormant. It is unclear if this used the Interactive Animation Series Controller, or another method. It is also unknown when this began and ended testing, and if it ever made it outside the Montfort store.
