<b><i>Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place), </b></i>is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> which opened on January 24, 1994, and is still open to this day with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}. This location is the second-closest location to the New York metro area to retain its animatronic show, with the closest being the {{< wiki-link "Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}} location, which has a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} stage. In May of 2024, Chuck E. Cheese announced that Hicksville would be one of 5 locations to keep its stage due to the CEC Legacy Location Program.
<h2>Stages</h2>
This location opened with a 1-Stage show right before the finalized version was released. In the original plans, Chuck E. would originally have his turntable installed, but it was quickly dropped. The stage had three screens instead of the usual two or one behind Munch. In the Early 2000s, the Tuxedo outfit would be replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. The Red Cap on the Chuck E. Bot was replaced with the Avenger cap in 2007 but never received the full Avenger outfit. Sometime in 2005-2008, the curtains would be shoved under the stage. (In which they would gather dust and dirt.)  In late 2013, Chuck E's avenger cap was removed. Chuck received Rockstar Jeans in 2019, while keeping his Cool Chuck shirt. The stage received its original lift curtains on July 17th.

<h2>History</h2>
Hicksville opened on January 24, 1994 with a 1-Stage. Upon its opening, the location was featured in a CEC Special Report segment, which was included in the showtape {{< wiki-link "Let The Good Times Roll" >}}. The store opened with the Major 90s Remodel which had the Record Posters, Green Booths, and other features. In the late 90s-Early 2000s, the store received Phase 3. Which included more decor being added, and a new exterior with the Thumb Chuck logo.
The restaurant had an initial expansion between 2004 to 2005. The restaurant was expanded again sometime in mid-to-late 2013<sup>(1)</sup>. Because of it, Hicksville had to get 2010 update to {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, and the entrance was reconfigured. The 2013 expansion utilized space from a Blockbuster Video location which had closed sometime between 2007 to 2011<sup>(2)</sup>.
<h3> Modern Updates </h3>
In modern times, the show at Hicksville would receive multiple updates and fixes by Tyler Lead, better known as 'Rockafire Moon.' These would include:<ul><li>Mechanical restorations of every character.</li><li>New masks made for Helen and Jasper.</li><li>A new snout and jaw made for Chuck.</li><li>New lights including inside of Pasqually's drums.</li><li>Tweaking Pasqually's hands to hold drumsticks in a realistic way.</li><li>New plastic feet for Chuck.</li><li>A deep cleaning of the curtains for its 2.0 Remodel. According to Tyler, this would take 9 washes and took about a week. The curtains themselves were found shoved under the stage.</li></ul>
On June 10th, 2024, the store would begin its {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}. The store would trash most of the art and replace it with 2.0 artwork. Some decor pieces from their {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} remodel would be hung back up on the wall. The store also received a 2019 Model dance floor.
CEC then announced on June 28th, 2024, that the Grand Reopening Party would be held on July 19th. A major grand reopening would be held on that day where various pieces CEC non-merch (Including pieces that were never seen after various remodels from stores like the character stars that were featured at {{< wiki-link "Staten Island, NY (1775 South Ave)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Lowell, MA (199 Plain St)" >}}.) was placed on one of the tables with a tag that told you not to touch it. As of September 2024, Hicksville has the 2.0 Remodel and 1-Stage.
