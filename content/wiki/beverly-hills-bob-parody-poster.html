The <b><i>Beverly Hills Bob</b></i> was a poster created for Showbiz Pizza and Chuck E. Cheese's in <i>1988</i>.
<h2>Production</h2>
This poster was one of the few Rock Afire Explosion parody posters released in 1988. Once {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} began this poster would cease production in 1990.
Unlike the {{< wiki-link "Mitzie (Parody Poster)" >}}, King Fatz (Parody Poster)|King Fatz, and {{< wiki-link "Pizza Wars (Parody Poster)" >}} posters, this poster in particular has never been re-released by Creative Engineering at any point after Concept Unification.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2>Design</h2>
The poster is a parody of 1984 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop"> Beverly Hills Cop</a>, with Billy Bob taking on the role 'Beverly Hills Bob'.
Much like the source material, Billy Bob is sat on a red 1984 Mercedes Benz 450 SL convertible in the streets of California. He is also seen in an unusual human like form, having more defined legs than any other artwork created for the character.
Because of the original artwork for Beverly Hills Cop having the main character flaunt a gun, the parody created by Showbiz has Billy Bob holding a newspaper.
