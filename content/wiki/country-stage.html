The Country Stage, also referred to sometimes as the 'barn stage', was a one of a kind stage design at the {{< wiki-link "North Richland Hills, TX (7935 Grapevine Hwy)" >}} Showbiz Pizza location. This stage was created by ShowBiz Pizza Corporate with the release of the Country Klunk showtape in January 1985.
Many ShowBiz Pizza locations would receive decorations and cosmetics for the country theme, like cowboy hats for each character, but none would ever come close to the barn stage concept.
<h2> History </h2>
This was one of many ways ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc. would try to freshen up the Rockafire Explosion every once in a while. The seasonal changes to Pizza Time Theatre's Balcony Stage were simulated and applied to the Rock-afire Explosion several times. The Magic Stage was the first concept to tested. The Country Stage would be the last time any new or major stage variations were developed by ShowBiz Pizza Time, mostly due to cost. Stage variations for Balcony stage were much cheaper to preform. The Country Stage would reappear in various 1986 ShowBiz Pizza Place ads. Although by this point the backdrop had been replaced with streamers and center stage receiving a neon 'Rock-Afire' sign. <sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> Design </h2>
All original Rockafire props were removed from the stage and replaced. New backdrops were installed. Each character kept their cosmetics from North Richland Hill's magic stage iteration. A helicopter light was added to the showroom, and would activate between every other show. Some of the changes that were included with the Country Stage would be undone later in its lifespan.
<h3> Center Stage </h3>
The center stage took upon the barn theme. Sun, Moon, Choo Choo, and Antioch were removed during this time. The backdrop depicted a large barn door with a protruding shape above it where some of the overhead lights were moved and hid behind. All of the floor floodlights became large, illuminated crates or boxes. Each stage would have lights like these. This would be very similar to what Circus Pizza would have years later. Beach Bear's guitar spotlight became laminated with pink. Fatz's organ legs became one leg that was connected at the middle of the organ, and gradually thinned at the edges towards the bottom as it reached the stage. The leg lights on the organ were removed, and instead strung with rope lights on each side, too.
<h3> Stage Left </h3>
Billy Bob and Looney Bird stayed cosmetically the same. The backdrop, which is also shared with stage right, was of a farm with a scarecrow and tractor. A picket fence was placed on the sides of the stage and above to hide overhead lights. Looney Bird barrel was changed to some kind of compost bin. It is also notable that this location was one of the first to have the Interactive Billy Bob software installed and tested. Kids used a physical microphone to talk to Billy Bob, and their voices could be heard through the show speakers. Both of these characteristics were changed at later locations.
<h3> Stage Right </h3>
This stage featured Country Klunk instead of Rolfe and Earl. Click still made an appearance with Klunk, despite the changes. The design would be similar to Stage Left and would feature a farm with a scarecrow and tractor. A picket fence was placed on the sides of the stage and above to hide overhead lights.<sup>(2)</sup>
