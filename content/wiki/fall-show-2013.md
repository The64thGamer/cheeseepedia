## Trivia:

- While this show was to begin playing on September 1st, stores with Existing Stages wouldn't receive the show until after the 6th, and those with Studio C/Weigl stages wouldn't get it until after the 13th. According to Matt Daniel, this was due to issues with the third-party agreement for the film *Free Birds*, as their in-store cross-promotion was not scheduled to begin until the 16th. There were also technical issues with the Studio C/Weigl version.
- With the newsletter for this show, stores were ordered to remove Chuck E.'s hat from all stages to match Chuck E.'s new look.
- Marvin The Technology Guru - 'Beards' was programmed for stores with Studio C / WEIGL and was part of segment 4, while it was an unprogrammed intermission for stores with Existing Stages featuring the Chuck E. walkaround. Additionally, the end of segment 4 would be different per stage type; on Existing Stages, Chuck E. would say "see you later, kids", while on Studio C, Marvin has a line about cars. The Existing Stage version would eventually be used on Studio C with the {{< wiki-link "Spring 2014 Show" >}}.
- The hidden timecode video for Studio C is a clip from one of the Chillout intermissions with the text "Hi Michael! This is just filler, to keep frame numbers from changing. Thanks for all that you do."
- The footage for 'I'm Gonna Dream' from the {{< wiki-link "September 2009 Show" >}} and 'New Shoes' from the {{< wiki-link "September 2011 Show" >}} are used as Chillouts with new music. The 2000s CEC logo on the pizza box at the end of 'New Shoes' is still present.
- A joke is made in segment 4 about Chuck E.'s voice sounding similar to the original singer of '1985', referencing Jaret Reddick being both the lead singer of Bowling for Soup and the voice of Chuck E.
