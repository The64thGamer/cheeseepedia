<b><i>Lion</b></i> (also known as <b><i>The Lion</b></i>) was a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Jasper T Jowls (Cyberamic)" >}} used at the {{< wiki-link "Fun Zone & Pizza" >}} on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}}. The bot was retrofitted after the location lost its license to the CEC IP.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> As Jasper T. Jowls </h3>
The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}.
<h3> As The Lion </h3>
In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Lion uses a generic <a href="https://www.halloweencostumes.com/mascot-lion-costume.html"> mascot costume</a> instead of the Jasper Cyberamic ones, though they still had the Cyberamics Cheese Guitar. The bot used Chuck E's lower half. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.
When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
