<b><i>Houston, TX (6760 Antoine Dr), Store #734</b></i><sup>(1)</sup> was a ShowBiz Pizza Place location that opened on July 15, 1981 with a Rock Afire Explosion and closed in September 2006 (day unknown) with a 3-Stage.
It was located in the White Oak Bayou Village Shopping Mall (formerly Evergreen Center and even earlier, Inwood).
<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally, when the store opened, it featured the Rock Afire Explosion band. In 1991, the location had received {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Installation Manual" >}} which involved the process of converting the Rock-Afire Explosion to the 3-stage. Munch's keyboard also had a unique front. They would keep their stage until September 2006, when they relocated to {{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (17780 Tomball Pkwy)" >}}. The bots were then uniquely auctioned off to private collectors, except for the Jasper bot, who was sent to the {{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)" >}}, being destroyed after the store's closure.
<h2> History </h2>
Houston, TX (Antoine) opened on July 15th, 1981 as part of the center it was in. There is hardly any info on the store when it was Showbiz Pizza, but it is known that between 1989-1990, the store would receive the 1988 remodel gaining the checkered patterns on the walls, receive the blue and white awnings above the salad bar, oil paintings and removing much of the Showbiz aesthetic scheme. Including replacing the Smitty's Super Service backdrop with the Showbiz Pizza Campground backdrop.
Soon after around 1991, Houston, TX (Antoine) received Concept Unification. In 1993, the store received {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} removing Oil Painting decor for the Record Posters. The store looked like this until the late 90's when it received the Phase 2 Remodel removing older decor for newer decor, though the Record Posters stayed, and replacing the ball pit for the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}. In September 2006, the store was closed without warning, {{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (17780 Tomball Pkwy)" >}} Everything from the games, appliances, posters, and even booths and tables, were all auctioned off either before or after the store closed. After everything was auctioned off, the store would close it's doors.
In 2007, a year after its closure, the store would be converted into another place called <i>Jump N' Fiesta</i>,<sup>(2)</sup> presumed to be a bouncy house playground center. This anchor would repaint the exterior of the former CEC space to rainbow colors, but kept the store's original awnings intact, and would operate until around 2010. That same year, the space would be converted into a party hall, with its exterior being completely repainted back to white during its conversion, including the intact awnings.
This space of the former CEC would eventually end up being split up into smaller retail space in 2016-2017. It remains this way to this day.
