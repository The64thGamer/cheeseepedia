<h2>Stages and Animatronics</h2>
The store originally opened with the Balcony Stage as shown on the November 1st, 1987 and September 11th, 1988 footage.
In 1989, the Balcony Stage was replaced with the C-Stage, or Chuck E.'s House Facade.
The walls that formerly contained the Warblettes and Drum Boards would remain throughout the remodels and were converted into artifact shelves during its 1990s remodel.
In 1993/1994, the Chuck E.'s House Facade would be removed and replaced with a 2-Stage.
The Pasqually Cyberamic would also receive 3-stage Pasqually shoes at some point before it's removal.

<h3> Lounge </h3>
The Cabaret Lounge was home to {{< wiki-link "The King  King Kat (Lounge)" >}} for it’s first few years. During its remodel in 1987 the lounge was converted into a private party area.

<h2> History</h2>
Silver Spring opened in March 1983 (Date Unknown) in the Briggs Chaney Market Place with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. It was also originally a franchised-owned location.
It wasn't franchised for long as on September 18th, 1986, Silver Spring would be bought by the corporate along with {{< wiki-link "Gaithersburg, MD (516 N Frederick Ave)" >}}.
In 1987, Silver Spring would be one of the first few to remodel during the efforts to unify PTT and SPP locations under one design. This can be attributed to this location for the way the store is absent of checkers and has a blue wall under the chair railing like most of the first few remodels. Silver Spring also appeared to receive artwork after the remodel.
In 1989, Silver Spring received the 1988 remodel removing older decor for newer decor, added Blue and White awnings, checkers, and replaced the Balcony Stage with Chuck E.'s House Facade, or the C-Stage.
Silver Spring remodeled once again between 1994 and 1995 during the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} and would receive {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} in their respective years. The booths in this location would be come one of the last of its kind, having only being used for earlier remodels at the time and were quickly phased out.
In 2006, Chuck E. Cheese and the Briggs Chaney Market Place would have a major exterior renovation, but did not receive the 2005 remodel.
<h3>Closure</h3>
On August 8, 2016, the store permanently closed. In 2018 the interior was completely gutted and rebuilt for the use of a short lived furniture store which closed after 1 years and then an antique store which closed after a few months. Silver Spring as of current is an Enterprise car rental which opened around 2020.
