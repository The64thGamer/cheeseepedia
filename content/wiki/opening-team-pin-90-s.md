The ***Opening Team Pin (Avenger)* was given to CEC employees for being the first employees during a store's opening, to be worn on their lanyard.**

## Design

The design is a metal pin featuring Coach Chuck art. The bottom section of the pin says 'Opening Team', alongside a section for the name of the store. The store name seems to be white plastic embedded into the metal with the name pressed and printed into it.

### Store Variations

- 'New Hartford, NY' ({{< wiki-link "New Hartford, NY (4631 Commercial Dr)" >}}, 2006)

## Acquirement

Employees could receive this pin if they filled any position within the first week of a store's opening.
