<b><i>W.O.O.F. Radio</b></i> was an animatronic show produced by Creative Presentations, Inc. (CPI) for Celebration Station from 1982 to 1989, being used in several of the chain's locations up through 2001.
Celebration Station's parent company, Whiteco, decided to officially end its relationship with Creative Presentations by 1990. Shortly thereafter, Sally Industries supplied the <i> Daniel and the Dixie Diggers Trio + Jethro P. Hogg </i> and <i>The Rockin' Rascals</i> animatronic shows for Celebration Station between 1991 and 1993.
<h2> Characters </h2>
<h4> Harry Hound </h4>
(Second Voice: Frank Gaughan) Harry is a white-furred dog who serves as the DJ for W.O.O.F. Radio. As Celebration Station's mascot, he also serves as the show's main host. He can be seen on the show's Stage Right.
<h4> Howard Le Trec </h4>
A small, reddish-brown-furred prairie dog is located left of Harry Hound on Stage Right. In the soundtrack audio, Howard is not referred to by name, but instead by "Gopher."
<h4> Purrscilla Purr </h4>
(Second Voice: Lorraine Denham) A brown-furred, curly blonde-haired cat serving as the sole pianist and female vocalist for the Pantones on Center Stage.
<h4> Peter "Big Bear" Panda</h4>
(Second Voice: Mark Brink) A baritone-voiced panda that performs on drums and serves as the straight man of the Pantones on Center Stage. When Merrillville, Indiana's W.O.O.F. show was renovated into a western saloon theme, Peter was replaced by an orangutan named Buford (a variation of CPI's "Putnam" character from their Ape-Ology's animatronic band).
<h4> Doc the Fox </h4>
(Second Voice: Gene Weygandt) A red-furred, youthful fox serving as the Pantones' electric guitarist on Center Stage.
<h4> Major Moose </h4>
(Second Voice: Larry Moran) The 'weather-moose' of W.O.O.F, Major is a dimwitted, but kind-hearted bass guitarist that can be seen on Stage Left.
<h4> Accu-Duck </h4>
A yellow-feathered duck that serves as Major Moose's assistant on Stage Left. He communicated in Donald Duck-mannered grunts and squawks.
<h4> Elsworth </h4>
Exclusive to the renovated western saloon version of Merrillville's W.O.O.F. show, Elsworth is an elderly chimp who occasionally banters with Harry and Major Moose on their shared stage from behind a set of shutter doors. He was originally a character from The Ape-Ology's animatronic band, also from Creative Presentations.
