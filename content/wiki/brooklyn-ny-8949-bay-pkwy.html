<b><i>8949 Bay Pkwy</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in February 1984 (day unknown) and closed on April 26, 1987 with a Balcony Stage. This was the last Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre to open in New York, as later locations opened as just <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i>.
This location is not to be confused with {{< wiki-link "Brooklyn, NY (139 Flatbush Ave)" >}}, which opened on July 22, 2004 with a Studio C Beta, 16M and is still open to this day with the 2.0 remodel.

<h2> History </h2>
Brooklyn's PTT opened in February 1984 (day unknown) in the Ceasar's Bay Shopping Center, and had a Balcony Stage. Sadly, not much info is known about this location, and few photos exist, but likely no videos. The location closed on April 26, 1987 for unknown reasons, but may be parking problems or leasing issues. As of July 2023, the location is now Bob's Discount Furniture and Mattress Store, just like the {{< wiki-link "New London, CT (389 N Frontage Rd)" >}} store.
