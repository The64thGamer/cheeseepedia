Birthday Star '98 was an edited release of the {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '95" >}} live show with the Mr. Mouth pre-show cut out, released for the {{< wiki-link "September 1998" >}} showtape. The show would continue to be used up to the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Holiday Party 2001" >}} showtape.

## Summary

The show is the same as {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '95" >}}, except for the Mr. Mouth pre-show being cut. The opening is instead replaced with either a small CGI clip of music notes or brief footage of a CEC location, as the instrumental leads into the main song. The stand-alone release of this live would include the 'Announcer' intermission from Studio C Premiere.

## Live Show List:

1. The Announcer

## History

Beginning with the release of the {{< wiki-link "September 1998" >}} and paired up alongside the live show 'Give My Regards To Broadway', Birthday Star '95 would be reissued as Birthday Star '98. This release of the show was identical to that of the previous, though the Mr. Mouth pre-show was removed as the character had not been used in years at this point. Now the show was presented in an identical form to Birthday Star '92 as an isolated song that simply played from beginning to end with no intro or outro. This reissue would be released on SVHS tapes for 3-Stage and R12, but it would not see a release on LaserDisc for Studio C. Instead, Birthday Star '95 remained included with every subsequent showtape release until August 1999, when Birthday Star '98 would see a release on DVD + Floppy. It would remain this way until January 2001, when Birthday Star '95 and '98 were discontinued in favor of its successor, {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star 01" >}}. This live would return temporarily in December 2001 due to {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Holiday Party 2001" >}} reusing its DVD from previous years.
