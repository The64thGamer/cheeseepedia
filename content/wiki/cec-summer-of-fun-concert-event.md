With someone named Jessi being an actor on the stage who spoke to Chuck and his gang (minus Pasqually)

## Summary:

With the help of Jessi &amp; Chuck E.'s Crew (Minus Pasqually) they're able to put on a show to entertain the guests using a mix of live shows and normal shows. After the show is over they would play various a mix of live show songs such as 'Happy &amp; U Know It' and licensed songs such as 'Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)'.

## Trivia:

- Play All You Can Play replaces Chucks vocals with helens during his 'Solo' and then replaces Munch's vocals with Helens during his 'Solo'
- Dog Days of Summer removes the rest of backing vocals and has Helen be the only backup singer and also sings some of Jaspers lines.
- Chuck E. Cheese's Birthday Song re-recorded all the backing vocals meaning you can now hear Helen, Jasper and DJ Munch clearly now
- Happy Birthday (Spanish) was rerecorded with the US voice actors.
- Song of Summer (Concert Remix) has Jessi sing Bella's lines and also ends the song after they all sing 'Sing a song of summer with me' to fade into them saying their goodbyes.
