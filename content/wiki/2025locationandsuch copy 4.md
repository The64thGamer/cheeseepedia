***Huntington Beach, CA (15031 Goldenwest St)*** is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on September 6th, 2025 as a relocation of the {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}} store.

## History

### Pre-Opening

On February 18th, 2024, a conversation between a fan and an employee at the {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}} store would reveal the store's plans to relocate to a new building. This would be due to the owners not wanting to renew the release, deciding to move the store to a nearby fabric store. The store would initially be set to close mid to late 2024. On March 12th bidding for contractors for the new location would commence on Parkway, with another round happening on October 4th, 2024. Huntington would continue operating past its initial plans for closure.

The store would first be found in construction on January 5th, 2025, being a former Joann fabric store. Rumors would also set the store's opening for August of that year. {{< cite 1 >}} The old store would close on September 21, 2025.

### Opening

The location would open on September 25th, 2025, with a proper Grand Reopening on October 2nd, 2025.{{< cite 2 >}}{{< cite 3 >}}
