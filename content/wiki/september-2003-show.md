## Trivia

- The logo shown on the monitor held by Chuck E. between songs is from the Existing Stage version of {{< wiki-link "January 2001 Show" >}}. The last few seconds of 'Larger Than Life' can also be seen before the logo appears.
- The countdowns in intermission 1 and 3 reuse music from the {{< wiki-link "August 1997 Show" >}}.
- Some of the stock footage in intermission 2's countdown previously appeared in the {{< wiki-link "September 2002 Show" >}}.
- Chuck E's curtains close during 'I Will Survive' on all versions, as well as Pasqually's on the 3-stage version. Chuck E's curtains also close during 'Respect' on the Studio C version.
- ‘Chuck E. Shuffle’ and 'Go Santa Go' appear on the Studio C DVDs but could not be played.
