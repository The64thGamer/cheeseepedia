<b><i>Winchester Foxy Colleen</b></i> was an animatronic produced by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} in October 1978 for the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} as the third PTT guest star, Foxy Colleen. The bot was used until 1981, when Winchester received {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}.
<h2>History</h2>
The Bot was installed in October of 1978 replacing {{< wiki-link "Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic)" >}} for the {{< wiki-link "Foxy Colleen I" >}} Showtape. They were the final Fantasy Forest Guest Star to be installed at Winchester, & the last Fantasy Forest bot installed at Winchester in general. The Bot was put in the 'The Great All-American pizza Show' Brochure in 1979<sup>(1)</sup>. As with other Winchester bots, her whereabouts after 1980 are unknown but she was most likely sent to {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}} after being uninstalled. After the bankruptcy in 1983 Foxy Colleen was presumably destroyed.
<h2>Design</h2>
She had long brown hair, a small green top hat with a black stripe and white 3 leaved clovers surrounding the stripe, light brown eyes, a white shirt, white necklaces around her left wrist similar to Winchester Madam Oink's, a green skirt with another 3 leaved clover on the front of it, a felt clover sticking out of her skirt, and a microphone mounted to her base like {{< wiki-link "Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V2 (Animatronic)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic)" >}}.
<h2>Movements</h2>
It's unknown what movements The Bot had at this time, but we do know they had a Eye movement, Mouth Movement, & Left Arm Raise.
