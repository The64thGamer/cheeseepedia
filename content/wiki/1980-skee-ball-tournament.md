The ***1980 Roll for Multiple Sclerosis*** was a charity event at all 15 then current Pizza Time Theatre locations which lasted from October 6th to the 16th in 1980.

## Description

The Skee-Ball tournament during its run would raise funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Each child 12 years or younger that participated would have PTT donate 5 cents for every 50-point ticket redeemed for charity. Three age groups would compete in the tournament. The plays were free and kids were offered one play for practice, and the best score from their next two plays  would enter them in the competition. Kids would fill out an entry card with their score and recieve a certificate stating "I Rolled for Multiple Sclerosis" with the amount PTT donated in the kid's name. The top winner in each category would recieve a certificate for merchandise from Jasper's General Store. Top store winners would be notified by mail and posted in the locations. The child with the highest score out of all stores would be declared "Roll for MS National Skee-Ball Tournament Winner". Sports writers and telecasters would also be invited to do their own form of tournament as well.{{< cite 1 >}}
