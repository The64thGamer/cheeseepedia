<b><i>Dolly</b></i> was a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Dolli Dimples (Cabaret)" >}} at <i>Jungle Jim's International Market</i> in Cincinnati, Ohio. (5440 Dixie Hwy, Fairfield, OH 45014)
Dolly was first installed in 1989 and removed in 1997
<h2>History</h2>
Dolly originally came from the {{< wiki-link "Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)" >}} Pizza Time Theatre and was bought by Jungle Jim's in Fall 1984. Dolly was first installed in 1989 being originally located next to checkout lanes (now exit doors for the 'Giraffe Parking'). Her stage was designed to look like she sat inside of a tree trunk with two palm trees positioned to the left and right of her with leaves covering the top. The backdrop was silver, yellow and orange streamers. Cosmetically Dolly would not recieve any updates to her design being identical to how she appeared at Pizza Time Theatre. In 1995 with the expansion Dolly would be re-located to "Jungle Jim's Bargin City" with the stage being identical. In 1997 with the construction of the "European Village" Dolly would be removed   with the last known photo of her being dated August 11th, 1997. Allegedly Dolly would then be used for parts for {{< wiki-link "Elvis (The King Retrofit)" >}}. As of today, the European Village still remains with no traces of Dolly to be found. 
<h2>Lost Media & Unknown information.</h2>
With how few photos/footage exists of Dolly it is currently unknown what she performed, the only evidence she worked is from 'The Jungle Jim Story' which features footage from 1991 of Dolly. Showing that she was at least aired up.<sup>(1)</sup>
