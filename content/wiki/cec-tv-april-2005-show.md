## Trivia

- Most of the intermissions in this show are reused
  - The two Charlie Rockit intermissions, 'Chuck E.'s Zoo View' and the footage in countdown 7 are reused from {{< wiki-link "Let The Good Times Roll" >}}.
  - The music in countdown 7 first appeared in {{< wiki-link "January 1995" >}}.
  - Countdown 2 reuses footage from {{< wiki-link "Dance Party 1999" >}}.
  - Countdowns 3 and 5 reuse footage from {{< wiki-link "January 2001 Show" >}}.
  - Super Jasper - 'Resist The Temptation' is reused from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Rockin' Rhymes" >}}.
  - Countdowns 1 and 6 reuse footage from {{< wiki-link "September 2001 Show" >}}.
  - 'Pasqually's Polka Minute' is reused from January 2002.
  - 'Pizza Survivor' is reused from {{< wiki-link "September 2002 Show" >}}.
  - VeggieTales - 'Belly Button' is reused from {{< wiki-link "September 2003 Show" >}}.
  - Countdown 4 uses the cut footage for 'Going On A Diet' from {{< wiki-link "September 2004" >}}. Also, the instrumental for 'Smile' is used for Countdown 3.
- In segment 3 when the video feed is rebooted, various pieces of footage appear on the screen. All of them are from this show with the exception of two frames from {{< wiki-link "You're A Star" >}}, those being a shot of Dick Frank in 'Frank's Barber Shop' and stock footage from 'Vacation'.
- The Studio C DVD contains a version of 'Nobody But Me' live which has text saying '8 Minutes to Showtime!'. This was a mistake and was fixed with a second version of the live which appears at the end of the disc. 'Super Jasper' also appears twice on the disc though there doesn't seem to be any reason why.
- This was the last show programmed by Matt Daniel before leaving the entertainment department and moving to California.
