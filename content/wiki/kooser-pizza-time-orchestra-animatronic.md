The Kooser Pizza Time Orchestra was an animatronic produced by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} in 1978 for the 2nd Pizza Time Theatre at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}.

## History

The orchestra debuted at the opening of the Kooser Rd location. It had a very similar appearance to {{< wiki-link "Winchester Pizza Time Orchestra (Animatronic)" >}}, although it was housed on a small shelf between Chuck and Jasper instead of all around the show room. It is unknown if the orchestra remained in use after Kooser had the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} installed or was replaced with the {{< wiki-link "Drum Board (Cyberamic)" >}}.
