<b><i>7110 S Westmoreland Rd, Store #949</b></i>, often referred to as <b><i>Redbird</b></i>, is a <i>ShowBiz Pizza/Chuck E. Cheese</i> that opened on September 15, 1982 as a corporate <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}. It is located in the Southwest Center Mall formerly known as the Redbird Mall. It is also the 100th store opened.
<h2>History</h2>
Westmoreland (Redbird) opened its doors on September 15th, 1982 with a Rock-afire Explosion show. It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout seen in many other stores across the United States and would eventually receive the 1988 remodel years after it would open. Although some documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Westmoreland (Redbird) was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package as well) sometime after opening. Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Westmoreland (Redbird) received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade.
In around 1991, Westmoreland (Redbird) received Concept Unification which converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 1990's, Westmoreland (Redbird) received the {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} remodel which removed some early 90's decor, added new decor, a new exterior, and SkyTubes. In around 2003-2004, Westmoreland (Redbird) would receive the 2003 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and also removing some older 90's decor (keeping the record posters in the showroom). Westmoreland (Redbird) remained this way until sometime in 2009-2011 when they received the 2005 Update which involved removing the record posters, replacing the dim lighting with brought florescent lighting, and removing some the art from the 2003 update. In the  Mid 2010's, a ticket blaster camera was added to the {{< wiki-link "Ticket Blaster" >}} which was located to the left of Stage Left before the 2.0 Remodel occurred. In May-June 2022, Westmoreland (Redbird) was one of the four locations to test the {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} alongside {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Grapevine, TX (2755 E Grapevine Mills Circle)" >}}, & {{< wiki-link "Irving, TX (3903 W Airport Fwy)" >}} locations. On August 8th 2022, Westmoreland (Redbird) started their 2.0 remodel and later on in the month, they removed the 3-Stage for the 2021 model Dance Floor & Video Wall. The grand reopening would later happen in mid-October the same year, in which a special navori show was made for the event, which not much information is known about it. As of August 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel and the 2021 model Dance Floor & Video Wall.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Westmoreland (Redbird) opened with the Rock afire Explosion in September 1982. Fortunately, there are some photos and videos to exist of Dallas (Westmoreland/Redbird) with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general, including a grand opening video.
In 1991, the store received {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, converting the Rock afire into the Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band 3-Stage. After the closure of the {{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)" >}}, some of the location's stage cosmetics would be sent to this store's stage. The condition of the center and right stages would be deteriorated sometime as early 2021, one of which being the arms of the Helen animatronic often being stuck held out across, which her right arm would eventually be stuck forever during the stage's last months of operation. The stage would eventually be removed around mid-August 2022 in favor of the store's 2.0 remodel.
