<b><i>ShowBiz Pizza Place Tape 1</b></i> was the first ever showtape produced for <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place's</i> hosting
the <i>Rock-afire Explosion</i>.
Despite the tape's manufacture date being January 12, 1980, it wouldn't debut at a ShowBiz Pizza Place store until July
of that year.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2>Summary</h2>
This tape would be the introduction of the Rock-afire Explosion to first time ShowBiz Pizza customers and staff at the
opening of the first stores. Each segment focuses on a main character and sets up their archetype and situation on
stage.
Heartaches sets up Dook's emotional singing, but doesn't include any dialogue.
Roast Beef Sandwich introduces Billy Bob and Looney Bird running <i>Smitty's Super Service Station</i> and their
solution to the 1979 Oil Crisis<sup>(2)</sup> with <i>Gas-O-Hol.</i>
This scenario presents Billy Bob's caring personality, and shows Looney Bird's drunken craziness through his use of
drinking the Gas-O-Hol.
Catch-A-Wave introduces Beach Bear's surfing personality and his goofy voice.
Hit the Cymbal shows off Rolfe and Earl's dynamic of insulting eachother- with Rolfe's egotistical showman attitude, and
Earl's uncaring sarcastic outlook. Throughout their comedy act, it seems like they're at odds, but it resolves with the
reveal they're doing what they can to entertain the audience together.
School Days oddly doesn't show much for Fatz, and is rather a section for the center stage to speak with eachother. Sun
and Moon also speak with the band despite rarely appearing later on.
Mitzi makes zero appearances in this tape outside backup singing, making a proper introduction for her not come till
much later.
<h2>Segment List</h2>
Notably this tape essentially loops its main segments twice, with every other loop containing a Rolfe & Earl skit.
