<h2> History </h2>
La Mirada opened on February 25, 1992 with a Road Stage and the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}}. There isn't much documentation on La Mirada during the 1988 remodel era. In the mid-late 1990s, they received the 3 {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}{{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}}{{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}}, removing 1988 remodel decor and remodeled the exterior, as well as installing Skytubes. There isn't much documentation on this era either.
In 2006/2007, La Mirada received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, removing all remaining 90s decor, removing showroom walls and balcony seating, painting multiple walls purple, and another exterior remodel. Their Skytubes were removed sometime before 2020. In November 2022, La Mirada received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Road Stage for a Dance Floor and Video Wall. The dome above the entrance was also removed. La Mirada remains like this today.
