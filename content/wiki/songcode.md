***SongCode* was an animatronic programming system made for Pizza Time Theatre, running from 1978 to 1990.
The first known usage would be at the second location {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}, with its hardware detailed in the SongCode Control System.
It was used to animate the {{< wiki-link "Kooser PTT Show" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}, and later {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} showtapes throughout the late 80's. The {{< wiki-link "Animation Programming System" >}} (APS) would replace it in 1990, staying as the main programming software till present day.**

## Software

The software was written in the [PDP-11 CISC Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture) for the main PDP-11, and later PDP-11/23, that ran it. Due to the PDP-11 having 16-bit hardware, its engineers were able to expand the unit's memory with an external device to be 32k of onboard memory.
By 1978 most PDP-11 users created programs on Unix 6th Edition, which could mean SongCode was written in the C Language, though the possibility of the program being written in raw Assembly or other languages is still possible.

## Encoding Format

The format is believed to be an earlier variation of what would later appear in the {{< wiki-link "Studio C 3x DVD + Floppy" >}} showtape format, being a command-based structure, rather than a snapshot based one.
