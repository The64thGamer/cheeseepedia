The **Countryside (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Farmer (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a farmer outfit with a ranch hat, red bandana, green shirt, blue overalls, a red towel in his overalls pocket, and while a piece of wheat hanging out of his mouth. In the background behind the statue is a cow statue.
