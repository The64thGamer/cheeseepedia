The ***PTT 3 Years Brass Pin* was given to PTT employees for their contributions in the store, to be worn on their lanyard.
The pin was made sometime after 1980, as 1980 has an official 'Three Years' pin, and was the first year employees would be able to receive that pin.**

## Design

This is a solid brass circular pin. Engraved is Chuck E. Cheese with his arms outstretched. Text below him reads:
`THREE YEARS`

## Acquirement

Employees could receive this pin after being an employee at Pizza Time Theatre for 3 consecutive years.
