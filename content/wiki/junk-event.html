<b><i>Junk Day</b></i> was a small trial event that took place at ShowBiz Pizza Places sometime in late 1983, most likely in October during {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" >}}. Customers would bring in junk to hang up on the walls in exchange for free tokens.<sup>(1, 2)</sup>

<h2>History</h2>
After the success of {{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)" >}} and its upcoming rerun during {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" >}}, the next promotional event would be planned with the junk theme in Fall 1983. During the run of Fall Festival between September 5 - November 11, the {{< wiki-link "4 Birthday Skits And 2 Junk Skits" >}} showtape would be sent out on October 11th to replace the birthday showtape. The two additional skits on the tape would promote the junk event.
<br>
It is unknown when the junk event started, as the showtape was released during Fall Festival. It is also unclear if the Showtape's junk skits were promoting the event directly for when it launched, or teased when it would release. No other promotional media can be found relating to the event. 
<br>
When the event launched, it is rumored that guests had begun to bring in trash and uninteresting pieces, which caused ShowBiz to shut down the event and not pursue similar ones like it again.<sup>(1)</sup>
