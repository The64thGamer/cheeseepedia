Birthday Star 2001 is a birthday show produced exclusively for Chuck E. Cheese's in January 2001. It is the third version of the long-running Birthday Star show. For Existing Stages, Birthday Star 2001 would be released both on its own tape and on other live show tapes alongside a birthday break.

## Summary

Birthday Star 2001 is a modernized update of Birthday Star '95 and builds on the foundation established by that show. Barring a couple of additional lines, it is lyrically identical to its predecessor and contains the same time signature and hip-hop styled beat. Instrumentally, however, it goes for a jazz and R&amp;B inspired style akin to the instrumentation of the shows being produced at the time, featuring eclectic drum rolls, crooning organs, and bombastic horns throughout. The show opens with a jazzy horn fanfare as the curtains open and Chuck E. Cheese emerges from his dressing room and greets the birthday stars and their guests. As the music begins to play, Chuck E. says 'Oh boy, I just love birthday parties. And look, there's the guest of honor!' and begins dancing with the birthday stars lined up in front of the stage. Chuck E. and the band then shout 'Haaaapppyy Birthday!' with Chuck E. then quipping 'Come on, let's celebrate!' Each of the band members then follows with their own interjections; Munch exclaims, 'Yeah, let's bring out that birthday cake', followed by Pasqually shouting, 'Now clap your hands, who is followed by Jasper shouting, 'Get on your feet', and finally Helen shouts, 'We're gonna share a special treat!'. The band leads the audience in the famous call-and-response identical to that from Birthday Star '95. Chuck and Helen say 'We say happy, you say birthday! Happy! \*birthday* Happy! \*birthday\*' with Munch, Jaspe,r and Pasqually responding with 'Birthday!' alongside the audience. Chuck E. proceeds with 'Clap your hands, \*clap clap clap* and stomp your feet \*stomp stomp stomp* and the band leads into the song's chorus. Chuck E. and the band lead into the happy birthday chant once more, followed by Jasper singing the bridge as Chuck E. dances with the crowd of kids. Chuck E. and the band then exclaim, 'Now let's not think ahead that far, today you are a birthday star!' with a reprise of the happy birthday chant performed afterwards, same as before. Chuck E. then leads the audience into singing the traditional happy birthday song, instructing 'Alright, everybody, let's sing happy birthday! 1, 2, 3!' and the band sings the traditional happy birthday song as the party hosts light the birthday candles. With the song sang, the band prepares the birthday stars to blow out their candles as the piano slowly crescendos note by note. The birthday stars blow out their candles, and the entire showroom gives them a thunderous applause. Without missing a beat, the band breaks out in a reprise of the chorus, then again in a higher key, and finally, they lead the audience in the birthday chant one last time. As the show reaches its finale, the song has another key change as the band joins together and sing 'Happy birthday from Chuck E., happy birthday to you! Yeah!' The song is closed out by an emphatic trumpet blast, and the audience gives a round of applause as the curtains close and Chuck E. returns to his dressing room.

## History

 The show would initially be released on its own SVHS tape for Existing Stages. Similar to previous birthday shows, it would also be included at the end of standard live show tapes alongside a birthday break. A shortened version of the show was included on Road Show CDs from its initial release in 2001 through 2012. The show would continue to be included with new showtapes for several years, with it being joined by {{< wiki-link "New Birthday (2002)" >}} in April 2002. In December 2007, Birthday Extravaganza was rolled out company-wide as the new standard birthday show, replacing Birthday Star 2001. Birthday Star 2001 would not be featured on any show DVDs past 2007; however, the SVHS release was considered valid by the entertainment department until the Summer of 2008, and it would continue to be released on new Road Show CDs up to 2012. Birthday Star 2001 would make a return in 2024, exclusive to the {{< wiki-link "Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}} grand reopening and Throwback Thursday show following its 2.0 legacy store remodel.
