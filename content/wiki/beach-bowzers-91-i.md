***Beach Bowzers '91 I*** is a showtape released for the Beagles / Beach Bowsers (Lounge) in March of 1991.

## Production

### Master Tape

The Master SVHS Tape for the show contains no signals, and states '3/11/91' during its intro, likely the date it was mastered. This date matches up with the APS modified dates for its files, which usually correspond to when programming was finished. Due to it being one of the few shows of the time to not contain any video, custom video is provided stating throughout: ELEMENT MASTER BEACH BOWZERS SONG (Song Number)

### APS Files

The show was a part of the {{< wiki-link "1990-1992 APS Floppy Cases" >}}, being split across two tapes. Other unrelated files are amongst the disks, such as the Road Stage random movements, {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '92" >}} live for C&amp;R and Road Stages, and the TV intro segment for both Cyberamics and 3-Stage.

#### Floppy Disk Label

The labels on the two floppies the files appear in states .APS files BEACH BOWZERS #1 #1 of 2 disks SONGS #1-8 recorded 10-90 animated 3-91 (total of 10 songs) \*RDMVIDMV.ROA disc #91-4 BOWZERS #2 .APS files (2 of 2 disks) SONGS #9-10 BIRTHDAY STAR FILES for C&amp;R and ROAD STAGES * BDAYSTAR.* = original BSTARMOD.* = added Mouths/lights w/chorus \*TVINTRO.HLF TVINTRO.3ST disk #91-5
