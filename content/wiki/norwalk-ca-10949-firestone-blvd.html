<b><i>10949 Firestone Blvd i</b></i>s a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on October 29, 1991, as a corporate location with a Road Stage which is still open to this day with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}.
It is located in the Firestone Shopping Center and opened on the same day as {{< wiki-link "Newington, CT (3075 Berlin Tpke)" >}}.

<h2>Stages</h2>
Like all Road Stages at the time, Chuck wore his tuxedo & derby. Lift curtains were added by the Late 90's. In the Early 2000's, the tuxedo and derby was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. By the late 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. The lift curtains were later removed.
In February 2024, the stage would be removed in favor the store receiving the 2.0 Remodel.

<h2>History</h2>
Norwalk opened on October 29th, 1991, as a corporate-owned location in the Firestone Shopping Center. Norwalk opened with the 1988 Remodel including the CU decor, and the Road Stage. Around the mid-late 1990s, they replaced the logo with Coach Chuck and removed older 90's decor for newer decor and the removal of the ball pit for SkyTubes. Norwalk remained like this until in 2006, when they received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, which involved the removal of the showroom walls, removing older decor for newer decor, new booths, relocating the stage, & adding purple walls. Norwalk still remains like this. Around February 2024, the store would receive the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, removing its Road Stage for a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}, which is how the store currently stands.
