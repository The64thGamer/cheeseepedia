The ***Golf (Magazine)* was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.**

## History

The statue in the design was a variant of a standard {{< wiki-link "Artifact Shelves" >}} Chuck statue in a golf uniform. The statue would be created by Peeler Rose Productions in 1993 with a full hand-crafted outfit.<sup>(1)</sup>

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Golfing (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a golfing outfit with a green & red hat, a light blue button down sweater, brown shorts, green socks, and black shoes that has a yellow lacing on the left and red lacing on the right. With Chuck E. holding a golfing stick about to hit a golf ball.
