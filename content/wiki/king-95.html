<h2>Trivia:</h2><ul><li>All of the songs in this show are from previous CEC showtapes with some lyrics changed to better fit The King. 'Party Place' and 'Baseball Diamond Dreams' are from {{< wiki-link "Spring Break" >}}, 'Chuck E. Shuffle' was originally a Chuck E. Shuffle |live show, 'Go Chuck E. Go' is from {{< wiki-link "January 1995" >}} and 'I Won't Give Up' is from {{< wiki-link "Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow" >}}.</li><li>This showtape is one of the last to be released as a reel-to-reel tape. A majority of locations had already converted to SVHS format for Cyberamic shows.</li><li>As this is the last cabaret showtape, it is likely that stores were instructed to play this tape until further notice. As a result, this show would continue for several months up until all Cabaret acts were removed from locations.</li></ul>
