<h2>History</h2>
Manhattan opened on August 18th, 1983 as the eighth and final ShowBiz Pizza Place in Kansas and as a corporate-owned store. Manhattan originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}}, receiving {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. Unfortunately, this didn't last long as in 1993, the Chuck E. Cheese closed for unknown reasons. A theory suggests that it closed due to the the lease expiring or there were a lot of rodent/car parking problems. After closure, the building became a (bowling alley?) and then a COX office which closed around 2017. Currently, as of March 2023, Manhattan is still abandoned.
<h2>Stages</h2>
