## History

The Colerain Ave ShowBiz Pizza Place opened up on November 11, 1981, opening in front of the former Gold Circle Mall {{< cite 24 >}} as the 2nd ShowBiz Pizza Store in Ohio. The store featured 'The Show Room, Sports Room, 60 Arcade games, a merry-go-round, and 'a magic cave'.' Colerain had unique showroom walls, which, unlike normal stores, had an entrance in the middle of the wall. In 1982, part of the support for the Bengals getting into Super Bowl XVI, ShowBiz Pizza ran a promotion at Colerain and {{< wiki-link "Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}. The event would happen January 24th, in which you'd watch the event on a 'Wide Screen TV' and also bring in cans of soup in return 'Four Free Game Tokens and the soup goes to charity'. {{< cite 6 >}}

They would receive Klunk in 1983 as part of {{< wiki-link "The Amazing Uncle Klunk Traveling Show (Event)" >}}.{{< cite 2 >}} They would also retain Klunk retrofitting him into Santa as part of {{< wiki-link "Santa On Stage Show 1983 (Event)" >}}.{{< cite 3 >}}

In 1985, two events were held at the ShowBiz Pizza Place, one being the Greater Cincinnati Youth for Christ hosted a social on March 31st and June 16th from 8-11pm. The event was titled 'Night Light', which featured a Pizza Buffet, Live Music from the Willoughby-Wilson Band. {{< cite 7 >}}{{< cite 8 >}}The other event hosted was a 'Teen Dance' event, which was a charity event to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which would take place on July 12th.{{< cite 9 >}} By 1987, ShowBiz Pizza Place and Pizza Time Theatre had merged, with the ads beginning to reflect that. Since by that point every other SPP and PTT in the area had closed, only Colerain and {{< wiki-link "Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)" >}} would be the only stores to show on these ads.{{< cite 10 >}} In the late 1980s, the Rock Afire Explosion would receive the ShowBiz Pizza Campground. In 1989, the ShowBiz Pizza Place sign was removed, with the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza sign being installed in its place. Colerain would receive the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}} around the same time. This would remove the last remains of the ShowBiz Pizza Place branding. {{< cite 11 >}}

### 1990's

Beginning in mid-1990, {{< wiki-link "Cincinnati, OH (4394 Eastgate Square Dr)" >}} had begun showing up in advertisements in the area following its June 1990 opening. {{< cite 12 >}} On April 28th, 1991 the Rock Afire Explosion would undergo Concept Unification turning the show into {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}, which completed in May.{{< cite 4 >}} Then in late 1991 the ShowBiz Pizza sign would be removed and replaced with a brand new 'Chuck E.

The store was removed in November 1997 after closing.{{< cite 15 >}} On July 20, 1993, an 'Informational Open House' was held by 'Chuck E. Cheese's/ShowBiz' to tell restaurant managements the facts about their growth in 1993 and their 'livable' schedules. This event would also have 'Paul Scappechi, Regional V.P. and Dan High, District Manager' to visit It is interesting to note they both misspell Colerain as 'Collerain' and Chuck E. Cheese's as 'Chuch E. Cheese'{{< cite 16 >}} Colerain would receive the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} in 1992 at around the same time that Sharonville would open up.
