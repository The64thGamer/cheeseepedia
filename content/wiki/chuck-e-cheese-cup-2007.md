The *2007 Chuck E Cheese Cup* was a Birthday cup made for Chuck E. Cheese restaurant's and released in 2007 by CEC Entertainment

## Design 

The cup featured on it was Chuck E. blowing into a party blower and Helen Henny popping out of a star, a cake , candles and tickets,  this cup would be 3d so Chuck E. would move side to side if you shake the cup, there was text on the cup that would read Be A Birthday star, this cup would be very rare to find since it was only used for one year in 2007
