## History

### Pre-Opening

On January 18th, 1979, Nolan Bushnell mentioned multiple planned locations, including one in Los Angeles. While Huntington Beach is part of Orange County and not LA County, Pizza Time Theatre was likely just finding a location to fit the Southern California market.{{< cite 1 >}} On February 12th, Pizza Time Theatre would mention 12 restaurants planned to open in 1979, though not directly mentioning Huntington by name.{{< cite 2 >}} 

On July 1st, the first direct mention of a location in Huntington Beach would occur, with Nolan Bushnell saying: "We now have sufficient data from the prototypes... to validate the strength of our concept. Based on the idea’s workability and profitability, we've made a decision to move quickly into the Los Angeles basin. I perceive this first Southern California store as the forerunner of dozens more to open in that area.". It would also note the location would be in the former Albetson's Supermarket, seating 350, and also be the home of the Pizza Time Theatre Southern California District Office. The planned completion for construction would be set for July 15th of that year.{{< cite 3 >}} The location would be 17,000 sqft. {{< cite 8 >}} 

On July 7th an ad would appear for an electrical technician for both the Huntington Beach and an unopened Santa Ana location.{{< cite 5 >}} 

### Opening

Huntington Beach would open on October 6th, 1979.{{< cite 9 >}}  The location would have the third set of {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}, alongside the first {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny (Lounge)" >}}. The store would also feature a 12x18ft concrete pad with six bumper cars as an attraction.{{< cite 7 >}} 

On October 9th, the C.&I. Construction Company would advertise their help in the construction of Huntington Beach.{{< cite 6 >}} 

### 1980's

On June 22nd, 1981, a paper going over the store would note a few of the current attractions at the location, the use of Madame Oink as the current Guest Star, the location having a Jasper's General Store, and that the location was doing well with over 90 employees. Nolan Bushnell would comment that the store was the best in the chain, staying busy every night of the week.{{< cite 8 >}}
