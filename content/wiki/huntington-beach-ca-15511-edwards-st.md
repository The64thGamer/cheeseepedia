***Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)*** is the fifth{{< cite 10 >}} {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}}, and the former Pizza Time Theatre Southern California District Office, opening on October 6th, 1979, and lasting to September 21, 2025.{{< cite 9 >}}

## History

### Pre-Opening

On January 18th, 1979, Nolan Bushnell mentioned multiple planned locations, including one in Los Angeles. While Huntington Beach is part of Orange County and not LA County, Pizza Time Theatre was likely just finding a location to fit the Southern California market.{{< cite 1 >}} On February 12th, Pizza Time Theatre would mention 12 restaurants planned to open in 1979, though not directly mentioning Huntington by name.{{< cite 2 >}} 

On July 1st, the first direct mention of a location in Huntington Beach would occur, with Nolan Bushnell saying: "We now have sufficient data from the prototypes... to validate the strength of our concept. Based on the idea’s workability and profitability, we've made a decision to move quickly into the Los Angeles basin. I perceive this first Southern California store as the forerunner of dozens more to open in that area.". It would also note the location would be in the former Albetson's Supermarket, seating 350, and also be the home of the Pizza Time Theatre Southern California District Office. The planned completion for construction would be set for July 15th of that year.{{< cite 3 >}} The location would be 17,000 sqft. {{< cite 8 >}} 

On July 7th an ad would appear for an electrical technician for both the Huntington Beach and an unopened Santa Ana location.{{< cite 5 >}} 

### Opening

Huntington Beach would open on October 6th, 1979.{{< cite 9 >}}  The location would have the third set of {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}, alongside the first {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny (Lounge)" >}}. The store would also feature a 12x18ft concrete pad with six bumper cars as an attraction.{{< cite 7 >}} 

On October 9th, the C.&I. Construction Company would advertise their help in the construction of Huntington Beach.{{< cite 6 >}} On November 28th, an interview with Nolan Bushnell about Pizza Time Theatre and its new location would have him note that he "...samples all the wares and makes sure that each of his theatres is producing the best possible food...", also noting that by this point seven stores had opened (despite only 6 known to be open).{{< cite 10 >}}

A survey for the coin boxes of various locations would be performed in late 1979, with PTT noticing both the {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny (Lounge)" >}} and the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} location's {{< wiki-link "Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic)" >}} having a 1:2 quarter to token ratio, unlike the usual arcades which had a 1:6 ratio. PTT believed this showed adults were activating the shows more than kids.{{< cite 14 >}} Around that time, the location would also note hosting 20 British editors of fast food and restaurant publications. The location would also already have tours by elementary schools, Cub Scout Packs, and Girl Scout Troops.{{< cite 14 >}} 

### 1980's

In February of 1980 the store would participate in the Photo Promotion campaign, snapping 1,450 pictures. The total snapped across the participating stores was 6,100. Huntington would take the lead out of the total. In May of 1980 it would be noted that the store would soon be recieving Artie Antlers. It is unclear if the location previously had a Dolli Dimples, or if this role was taken by the Helen animatronic.{{< cite 15 >}} Around this time the store would also recieve its beer and wine license, holding a provate employee celebration for the occasion. The store had also recieved at least one tour a day for the prior two months of business.{{< cite 15 >}}

In early 1981, the store, {{< wiki-link "La Habra, CA (901 Harbor Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Fullerton, CA (1841 W Orangethorpe Ave)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Garden Grove, CA (11889 Valley View St)" >}} would participate in the "Pizza Leagues" where softball players at each store would compete. These four stores and the {{< wiki-link "Long Beach, CA (4706 Los Coyotes Diagonal)" >}} location would alsp sponsor California Surfs soccer team's MVP award.{{< cite 16 >}} On June 22nd, 1981, a paper going over the store would note a few of the current attractions at the location, the use of Madame Oink as the current Guest Star, the location having a Jasper's General Store, and that the location was doing well with over 90 employees. Nolan Bushnell would comment that the store was the best in the chain, staying busy every night of the week.{{< cite 8 >}}

During the first two weeks of August 1981, Huntington Beach, {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "San Ramon, CA (1901 San Ramon Valley Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Garden Grove, CA (11889 Valley View St)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Long Beach, CA (4706 Los Coyotes Diagonal)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "San Diego (Mira Mesa), CA (9840 Hibert St)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Modesto, CA (3037 Sisk Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Pinole, CA (1570 Fitzgerald Dr)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Orlando / Winter Park, FL (1300 Lee Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Tampa, FL (1707 E Fowler Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Fort Worth, TX (8740 Hwy 80 West)" >}} would have customers play arcade games in contests to win a chance at being on the pilot for the upcoming TV show 'Starcade'. Random contestants were also selected from home entry forms that were submitted at these locations.{{< cite 17 >}} The pilot would air on September 13th, 1981, which had all 24 contestants win a party for 10 at their local PTT.{{< cite 18 >}}{{< cite 19 >}}

In late March of 1983, the store would hold a fundraiser for the Paul Yorde Day Care Center. The kids of the center would be there for the day during the event.{{< cite 11 >}}

In the early morning of April 1st, 1985, the store would be have around $5,000 in cash stolen. Two gunmen kidnapped a PTT employee who was at the back of a Bank of America building, forcing them to drive back to the restaurant and let them in before opening. The victim was tied up and beaten by the gunmen, alongside a .45-caliber handgun being fired near the head of another employee as a warning. The men would have the phone lines cut before fleeing. It is unclear if they were ever caught.{{< cite 12 >}}
