## Trivia:

- This is the final showtape to have segments in between songs.
- This is the final showtape to be created with the puppets being used only between songs for Studio C
- The backdrop for the Studio C puppets in the first two segments are the Studio C curtains (likely from Dept. 18's stage). The backdrops for the latter two segments are the same from Fall 2013 Show|Fall 2013 due to the footage being reused.
- Show Break 1 reuses the footage from 'New Shoes' even keeping the Avenger logo towards the end.
- The footage for 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' was edited to remove the Avenger walkaround except for a few shots where his back is turned to the camera.
- In 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' Jaret's voice was recorded over Duncan's voice so you can hear the backing of Duncan's voice during the song, It's most noticeable during the bridge & final chorus.
- Marvin the Technology Guru - Beards is now an intermissions for all stages whereas it was programmed as part of segment 4 for the Studio C/Wedegi version of Fall 2013.
- This is the 4th time a cover of 'Everybody Have Fun Tonight' has appeared in a showtape following CEC Personal Favorites Showtape|CEC Personal Favorites, {{< wiki-link "CEC Dance Showtape" >}}, & {{< wiki-link "April 2012 Show" >}} making it one of the only songs to appear in 3 different vocal eras of CEC & to have 4 different covers based on the showtape being played.
- 'Final Countdown' removes the dialogue during the drum solo.
- The instrumental for 'Back in Time' is from {{< wiki-link "September 2007 Show" >}}
- At the end of April 2014 footage shows the end of a 1988' Training tape created by ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc.
- The Live Show countdown for this show is the Cyberstar countdown from the 80s.
