***Spee-Lunker's Cave*** (Officially reffered to as simply ***The Cave***) was an Animatronic and Audio Water Dark Ride at Six Flags Over Texas from Summer 1964 until it's removal in 1991. The Ride was a part of the 'Old South' section of the Park, and featured a Texan cave full of Aliens called 'Spee-Lunkers'.
## History
### Production
The Cave began production sometime in 1964 as a concept under the vision of Randall Duell {{< cite 1 >}}. The characters, the Alien species of 'Spee-Lunkers' named after a play on the word 'Spelunker', were designed by Walter McKeegan {{< cite 1 >}}. The Concepts were merged as one attraction sometime later, with the Spee-Lunkers being Aliens who lived in a cave after living with Huamns for a while.
The Props, Sounds & Music, and Small Electric and later Pneumatic Animatronics were designed by Franklin 'Gene' Patrick and painted by several unnamed employees {{< cite 1 >}} {{< cite 2 >}}. The Attraction originally contained 28 Figures as part of different mini shows and gags across each segment of the ride.
The Segments would go through a winding layout eventually ending in a Spinning Tunnel, Skiing Spee-Lunkers, and the exit tunnel {{< cite 3 >}} {{< cite 5 >}}.
The Ride system was produced most likely by Arrow Development (Later Arrow Dynamics) though this isn't confirmed.
The Ride took $300,000 to complete over a 13,300 Square Foot area {{ cite 1 >}}.
### Opening & Operation
The Ride opened by June 1st of 1964 as it had been scheduled for Late May {{< cite 1 >}}, quickly becoming a fan favorite under the nickname 'Spee-Lunker's Cave' {{< cite 1 >}}. The Ride featured Fiber Glass Tub boats but they were replaced by 1966 with larger Oval boats. An Advertisement was produced in 1964 for the Opening of the Attraction {{< cite 4 >}}. The Original entrance sign was later removed and a new carved one was added above the ride's entrance {{< cite 2 >}}.
Throughout the 1980's, several revisions to the Ride were made including adding and replacing scenes, and changing the ending to feature a Spee-Lunker version of The Alamo {{< cite 1 >}} {{< cite 2 >}}. Several smaller changes and revamps were also done over the years both to repair the ride and to add new decor.
Six Flags Over Texas, wanted to add a Warner Brothers Attractions decided to replace The Cave. The Cave closed in either late 1990 or Early 1991 and was fully guttedby 1992. All Spee-Lunkers were sold or sent to museums/private collections.
### Legacy
In 1992, 'Yosemite Sam and the Gold River Adventure!' opened in the former area with Animatronics produced by Sally Corporation in June of 1992 {{< cite 6 >}}. The Ride later closed in September 2018 after a flood between the 21st and 22nd, and replaced by 'Pirates of Speelunker Cave' in 2022.
'Pirates of Speelunker Cave' uses many of the same elements as the original ride.
The Ride itself remains a fan favorite among many Dark Rides fans even during the early 2000's. Many even pwtitioned for the Ride's return during the 2000's, sementing it's place in the Parks' history.
