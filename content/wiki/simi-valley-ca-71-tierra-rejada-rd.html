<b><i>71 Tierra Rejada Rd, Store #411</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened on October 20, 1980, with a Shelf/Portrait Stage, and closed in May 2008 with a Chuck E.'s House.
This location is mostly known as having the second to last location with the 'Chuck E.'s House' stage setup, notably being featured in was featured in CheeseVention 4 in May 2007.
<h2>Stages</h2>
The location opened with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Portrait  Shelf Stage" >}} in October 1980 then was replaced with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}} most likely in 1990. The setup would also be repainted to bright colors and have its original cosmetics replaced at various periods of time. Sometime in the early-mid 90's Munch would receive his sports cap which he had until closure. In the early 2000's, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit, which also remained until closure. (This was the only Chuck E.'s House to receive this outfit as {{< wiki-link "Rockford, IL (3600 E State St)" >}} had their vest until 2009 when they replaced it with the Avenger Outfit).
The location would have a {{< wiki-link "Dolli Dimples (Cabaret)" >}} in the Piano Bar and a {{< wiki-link "Dr Quack (Cyberamic)" >}} in the Cabaret, the currently only known appearance of Dr. Quack at a store.<sup>(1)</sup>
Due to this location opening on October 20th, 1980, and the King debuting in 1981, it is possible that this location originally had The Beagles before receiving The King sometime before 1986.<sup>(2)</sup><sup>(3)</sup> In the 1990s, the location would replace lounge act entirely with the <i>Video Velocitor</i> in the former lounge area.
<h2>History</h2>
Simi Valley opened its doors on October 20, 1980, in a shopping center adjacent to K-Mart near the corner of Tierra Rejada and Madera Roads. The opening date was originally proposed to be sometime in December 1980, but crucial evidence proved this false. It opened with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Portrait  Shelf Stage" >}}, being one of the last ones to ever be installed. The exterior sign was likely switched out in 1981/1982.
Simi Valley first remodeled with the 1986 SPT Remodel Program in 1990, which involved changing the name of the establishment to 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza', installed awnings above the counters, added checkers around the store, and removed the Portrait Stage for {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}}. Around 1994/1995, the location remodeled to {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}, which involved renaming the establishment to just 'Chuck E. Cheese's' and updated every aspect around the store except the showroom and lounge area. Around 1995, The King, their lounge act, was removed and replaced with the Video Velocitor. Simi Valley only received minor updates throughout the years, including switching out several booths, and new game packages. In May 2008, Simi Valley closed down for unknown reasons. This meant the {{< wiki-link "Rockford, IL (3600 E State St)" >}} store had the very last Chuck E.'s House. Not long after closure, the location, as well as the rest of the center was demolished for a Target and some other shops. As of June 2023, Target and the other shops still remain on the space.
