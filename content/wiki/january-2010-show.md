**January 2010** is the first and only show to use the AM and PM Schedule for Studio C. The AM show reuses the {{< wiki-link "Just for Kids Show 2000" >}} segments and the PM / Existing Stage shows reuse the {{< wiki-link "CEC TV April 2005 Show" >}} segments.
This played from January to April 2010.

## Cyberstar 2.00 Update for Studio C

This update created contained a provision for initiating an alternate show schedule at a pre-defined time during the day. From the time the show is started until the pre-determined 'swap' time, (Which would be managed by the Entertainment Department) the controller will play shows from the primary schedule. After the 'swap' time has passed, the controller will revert to playing shows from the alternate schedule.<sup>(1)</sup>
