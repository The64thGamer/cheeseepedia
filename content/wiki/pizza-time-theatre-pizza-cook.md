***Pizza Time Theatre 'Pizza Cook*' is one of the first *Pizza Time Theatre* training tapes, released in December of 1981, and used until sometime in 1984.
The tape focused on the cooking portion of an employee's job, being put on a film cartridge with no audio.**

## PTT Training Center

The tape was part of the {{< wiki-link "PTT Training Center & Test Kitchen" >}} program held exclusively at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (2445 Fontaine Rd)" >}} location, potentially meaning only one copy was ever made. The tape was also part of a set of training tapes, with the only other one known being the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Cashiering" >}} tape.
