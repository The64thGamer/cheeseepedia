***The Singing Flowers* were prop characters at *Pizza Time Theatre* restaurants. They were designed to replace the {{< wiki-link "Warblettes (Cyberamic)" >}} when a *Balcony Stage* was converted to a *Rocker* or *C Stage*. They were very simple characters with only a single mouth lever inside them. They would use the same bit as the Warblettes Mouth and this allowed the Warblettes to still function on stages that still had them.
*The Singing Flowers* were phased out during the introduction of the *Road, 1 and 2 Stages*. They were still programmed throughout the 90's and until 1999-2001, as corporate had a set installed on their *Road Stage*. They likely went extinct around then as photos of *Rocker Stages* in the late 90s and 2000's do not have them anymore. Some stages seemed to never even have these installed at all.**
