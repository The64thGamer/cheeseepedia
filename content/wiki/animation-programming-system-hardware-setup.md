The ***Animation Programming System (APS) Hardware Setup* is a collection of devices used by Chuck E. Cheese's to program animatronic shows on the {{< wiki-link "Animation Programming System" >}} software starting in 1990.
APS and its hardware would be a direct upgrade to the {{< wiki-link "SongCode" >}} programmer and its {{< wiki-link "SongCode Hardware Setup" >}}, using many similar concepts and devices.**

## Setup

It is currently unclear what the original hardware is, though the keyboard shown looks to be an IBM Model M keyboard.

### 2001 Setup

(TODO: Examine and detail setup)
