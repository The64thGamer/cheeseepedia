The first ***Pizza Time Theatre Fantasy Forest Game Preserve* sign first appeared at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} located in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center in San Jose California; where it was placed at the main Fantasy Forest Game Preserve entrance from November 1978 to an unknown year.**

## Production

While no specific information is documented on its production, let alone existance, we can theorize it was produced by either a contracting company, or at the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Mountain View, CA Corporate Office" >}} located in Mountain View, California. The former is the most likely scenario.

## Usage

The sign was first used at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on 1371 Kooser Road from November 1978 to an unknown year, presumably 1981. The sign was used alongside the {{< wiki-link "PTT Pasquallys Perfect Pizza Sign (1978)" >}} at the main Fantasy Forest Game Preserve entrance. After its usage, several scenarios could have played out, those being:
**A.** The sign was kept in storage at the location itself to an unknown year and thrown out.
**B.** The sign was sent to the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}} and was thrown out pre-merger.
**C.** The sign was sent to the Sunnyvale Corporate Office and was destroyed during the move from the Sunnyvale Corporate Office to the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}

## Design

The Fantasy Forest Game Preserve main entrance sign would follow a design of the text 'Chuck E. Cheese's Fantasy Forest Game Preserve' placed onto a sign mimicking a bush, which fit the style of the new Fantasy Forest Game Preserve concept.
