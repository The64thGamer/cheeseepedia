### Unconfirmed Stores

Due to evidence that {{< wiki-link "Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}} installed their sign mech for {{< wiki-link "Country Klunk" >}} in 1985, a store that wasn't open until November 1, 1984, stores that have sign mechs installed do not confirm whether they had received Klunk in 1983, or at a later time. These stores are currently unconfirmed due to this:

- {{< wiki-link "Dallas, TX (7110 S Westmoreland Rd)" >}}
- {{< wiki-link "Houston, TX (5535 Weslayan St)" >}}

Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q
