Buford Buffalo was an animatronic produced by Creative Engineering Inc. for the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}}. He is a Buffalo head who comments on the show between skits, and interacts with Mortimer Moose. Buford often tries to correct Mortimer throughout their skits. (1)

## History

Buford Buffalo along with the rest of the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}} show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984, and currently resides at the CEI museum. Buford Buffalo, along with Mortimer Moose, would be restored with the rest of the show, and would later be reused for promotional material and IAAPA events. This was likely to try and resell the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}} to new owners. As him and Mortimer aged, their masks would begin to melt, and they would become known as the Melting Moose and Buffalo

## Design

He is a Buffalo head with short horns, and Brown eyes. He is mounted to a wall in the Bear Country Jubilee showroom, next to Mortimer Moose. He is based on Buff from the Country Bear Jamboree, the show which was the inspiration for the Bear Country Jubilee
