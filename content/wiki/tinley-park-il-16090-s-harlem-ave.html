<b><i>16090 S Harlem Ave, Store #58</b></i> was a <i>ShowBiz Pizza</i> that opened on January 31, 1989, with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}}, which is still open to this day as a <i>Chuck E. Cheese</i>.
<h2>History</h2>
Tinley Park opened on January 31, 1989, as a merger store with one of three Rocker Stages in Illinois, the other two being in {{< wiki-link "Rockford, IL (3600 E State St)" >}} & {{< wiki-link "Streamwood, IL (990 S Barrington Rd)" >}} with the 1986 SPT Remodel Program|1988 Remodel. They would remain this way until around 1994 when they did their first remodel which involved the conversion from Chuck E.’s House to 2-Stage & the addition of 1990 store art (Removing elements from the 1988 Remodel such as The Blue & White Awnings, checkers around the store, & neon lights). When they got the 2-Stage, they replaced Chuck's outfit with the Tuxedo & Derby and replaced Helen’s mask. Between 1999-2002, Tinley Park expanded the right side of the game room to make room for more games. Pasqually got a new mask in 2000 and Helen in 2002. In the Early-Mid 2000s, Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. Around this time, Jasper's PTT mask would be replaced with a new one as well. They would then remodel again to the 2005 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in around 2006-2007 which involved removing all 1990s store art, Balcony Seating, Showroom Walls, & adding purple walls. In April-May 2012, Tinley Park was to expand the front of the store which added a new facade, bigger windows, & even more floor space for games. In September 2022, Tinley would receive Chuck’s head, mask, two valve boards, and Pasqually’s mask from {{< wiki-link "Chicago, IL (1830 W Fullerton Ave)" >}} after they removed their stage for 2.0. Originally Chuck E was going to receive the full Avenger outfit from Fullerton but in the end Chuck E kept the Cool Chuck outfit. Sometime in August 2023, the big CRT TV was replaced by a flat screen TV. In November 2023, Tinley Park's {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} would begin, with the stage being removed on November 26, 2023<sup>(1)</sup> The store left the exterior intact (albeit the Avenger logo replaced with the 2.0 logo.) The location would celebrate their grand reopening in December 2023. As of January 2024, Tinley Park has the 2.0 Refresh remodel along with the 2021 Model Dance Floor and Video Wall.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally, the store opened with a Rocker Stage, which they had until the Mid 1990's until their first remodel. In 1994, it was converted into a 2-Stage which it had until it was removed on November 26, 2023, for the Dance Floor.
