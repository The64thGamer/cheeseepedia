The Stage debuted at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}<sup>(1)</sup> location in May of 1980, and went extinct in 1993 at the {{< wiki-link "Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (9271 34th Ave)" >}} location. from 1988 to 1989, most Stages would become {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}.****

## History

### Pre-Production

In Early 1980, after the opening of {{< wiki-link "Sparks, NV (530 Greenbrae Dr)" >}} & {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)" >}}, Pizza Time Theatre wanted to make a more standardized Portrait Stage. The final outcome would be replacing {{< wiki-link "Kooser PTT Show" >}} with a new stage called 'Showboat'.

### Pizza Time Theatre

#### Early Balcony Stages

The Showboat stage was placed at Kooser's Showroom in May of 1980. The stage would turn out to be a success & would later be installed at the opening of {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}} in October 1980 which had Madame Oink instead of Foxy Colleen & the Showtape being either Madame Oink II or {{< wiki-link "Around the World with Madam Oink" >}}. Arlington's Blacony was also more like the later Balcony Stages with the characters being lower down & their being a Cheese-Crawl.
Most locations still opened with a Balcony Stage until December 1980. The Balcony stage was installed at all PTT locations afterwards.

#### Later Balcony Stages

The 'Irish Stew' & '{{< wiki-link "Around the World (PTT Theme)" >}}' Showtapes would have special theme for Balcony Stages. The Balcony Stage would have variants for most other Showtapes following. A Balcony Stage would be installed at the Amusement Park, 'Kids World' in the early to mid 80's, The stage wasn't segmented, meaning their were no barriers between the bots, & there was a strange backdrop behind the characters.

### ShowBiz Pizza Time / Chuck E. Cheese's

After {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} would buy out PTT from 1984 to 1985, they would continue to open {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} locations until January 1986, with the last location being in {{< wiki-link "Fairbanks, AK (600 Old Steese Hwy)" >}}. In 1987, {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}} would replace their Balcony Stage with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}}. All locations forward would open with a Rocker Stage & several existing locations also switched to Rocker Stages. In 1988, ShowBiz corporate would set up Chuck E.'s House Facades to replace the fronts & backdrops of Balcony Stage, to make them look like a house.
The last Balcony Stage would be located at {{< wiki-link "Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (9271 34th Ave)" >}} which was replaced in 1993 for a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}.

### Present / Chuck E. Cheese

The Balcony Stage would appear as a cameo in a few modern era CEC Shows, mostly as a flashback.

### Similar Stage Types

The stage at {{< wiki-link "Lake Forest, CA (24416 Muirlands Blvd)" >}} would be merger between a Portrait Stage & a Balcony/House Facade Stage, with the stage being removed with the locations closure in 2001.
