**Land Of 1,000 Dances** is a live show released September 1991. This show ran from September 1991 - July 1993.

## Summary:

Chuck and the band performs ['Land Of 1,000 Dances'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_a_Thousand_Dances). Then Chuck says they'll be singing one of their favorite original songs, leading into Chuck E.'s Place which is the same as the January 1991 version of the show, except having all of Helen's lines replaced with Chuck's vocals. At the end, an announcer lists the show's cast and the live then ends.
