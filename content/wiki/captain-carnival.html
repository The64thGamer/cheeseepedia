Captain Carnival, also known as Captain Carnival's Pizza Theatre, was a chain of restaurants in the 1980s. 

<h2> History </h2>

The first and main location opened in Winsdor, Canada, at {{< wiki-link "7755 Teschuma Road, E" >}} on March 7th, 1983. At some point in 1983, multiple licenses for franchising were sold- two in Massachusetts, three in Vancouver, two in Toronto, and one in London- however, the one in London, set at {{< wiki-link "1051 Wellington Rd." >}}, is the only one confirmed to have opened. Locations were also potentially set to open in Atlanta, GA, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, and New Jersey.

In August of 1984, the Winsdor location put up a sign for renovation that would stay there for two months, with the building officially being replaced by a Chi-Chi's in August of 1985.

<h2> Shows </h2>
Captain Carnival's had two main animatronic shows.

<h3> Main Show </h3>

The main show, which is currently nameless, was at the center of the restaurant on a large pirate ship. It featured 3 animatronic characters and would cycle through 10 different skits.

<h4> The Captain </h4>
The mascot of the restaurant, a mix of clown and pirate.

<h4> Pinza </h4>

<h3> Davey Jones n The Beach Bones </h3>

The secondary show featured at Captain Carnival's. A parody of the Beach Boys made up of a group of skeletons, they allegedly had original songs, song parodies, and would also tell stories.
