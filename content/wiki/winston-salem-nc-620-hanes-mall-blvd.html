<b><i>620 Hanes Mall Blvd, Store #121</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It is currently one of two operating CEC locations in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_Triad"> Piedmont Triad metropolitan area</a>, the other being the {{< wiki-link "Greensboro, NC (702-A Pembroke Rd)" >}} on Pembroke Rd.
This location opened on January 8, 2000 in the Pavilions Shopping Center with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} and is still open today with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} as of October 2023. Another thing to mention is that Winston-Salem opened a day after the {{< wiki-link "Long Island City, NY (3419 48th St)" >}} location, which is also still open today with the 2.0 remodel.
<h2> History </h2>
Winston-Salem was one of the first four Chuck E. Cheese locations to open in the new millennium. This store most likely opened with the 1999 update to the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}}, which included 1991-1999 wall decor, dim lighting, and showroom walls. For the gameroom, Winston-Salem either had {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} game package or the new-at-the-time {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} game package, which included the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} attraction, the Toddler Zone, Kid Check, and new arcade games which included both third-party games and CEC-branded games. For the showroom, Winston-Salem featured a Studio C Alpha stage, which had a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic)" >}} along with the {{< wiki-link "Bird (Animatronic)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Pizza Phone (Animatronic)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Clock (Animatronic)" >}} animatronics. Other features included the bluescreen, the camera, and the {{< wiki-link "Interactive Console" >}}. At an unknown point prior to September 2007, Winston-Salem received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved the removal of showroom walls, addition of purple walls, removing older 1990s wall decor for newer 2000s wall decor, new turquoise booths, benches, and new exterior signage. Winston-Salem's exterior was somewhat unique because the 'Chuck E. Cheese's' lettering was white, the old 1990s lettering was kept for their 2005 remodel update, and the awnings were different than any other {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} themed store.
In the fall of 2013, the Studio C Chuck E. bot's hat would be removed due to CEC corporate requiring stores to 'remove & destroy' Chuck E's hat from the animatronic in order to coincide with the new look of Rockstar Chuck, as said in the newsletter<sup>(1)</sup> for the new-at-the-time {{< wiki-link "Fall Show 2013" >}} show. In the fall of 2022, Winston-Salem's Studio C stage stopped animatronic programming due to the {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} not being able to support the hardware of Studio C shows for playing back animatronic signals. It is unknown if the animatronic was set on Random Movements or if it was powered off altogether. In March 2023, Winston-Salem started their 2.0 remodel, and on March 26, 2023, the Studio C Alpha would be removed, and what happened to the animatronics are currently unknown. As of October 2023, they still have the 2.0 remodel to this day. Winston-Salem was the second CEC location in the Piedmont Triad area to receive the 2.0 remodel, after Greensboro started theirs in June 2022.
