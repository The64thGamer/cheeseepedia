The **CU Beta 16m** was a stage format found two {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} locations in the state of Illinois in the United States that converted their {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}} in 2020. The stage consisted of a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 16m setup but on a 3-Stage platform. It was the most recent CEC animatronic stage to come out, despite it not being an official stage type.

## History

The **CU Beta 16m** was created to replace {{< wiki-link "Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)" >}}â€™s 3-Stage due to maintenance costs. The decision was to replace the 3-Stage with parts of the Studio C Beta from the recently removed show from {{< wiki-link "Joliet, IL (3250 Chicagoland Circle)" >}}. Installation begun on July 1, 2020. With everything on center stage being removed (with the exception of the fiberoptic fireworks) and thrown out to be destroyed along with the neon sign on stage right being removed. During this time Stage left and right were still running with the Beta TV light fixtures hidden behind the TV on stage right. On July 2nd the bot, Swirl fixture, and the two TV light fixtures were installed although not functional yet. On July 6th the stage was finally in a state where it could run. In its first few tests all the lighting worked with the center stage floods and fiberoptic fireworks being reused. By mid-July, the stage was fully complete with curtains being installed over stage left and right coming from {{< wiki-link "West Des Moines, IA (1431 22nd St)" >}}. Behind the curtains starting on stage right was the CRT and rain curtains and on-stage left was the Pasqually's Amateur Hour wall, flood light covers and the platform for Pasqually. Everything on Pasqually's stage was eventually removed sometime in 2021 with the exception of the flood light covers. In June 2023, the stage was removed for the 2.0 remodel. In early November 2020 the {{< wiki-link "Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}} location replaced their 3-Stage with the **CU Beta 16m** this time coming from Lafayette, IN (100 S Creasy Lane). They reused the buildings and planters (with one breaking) from the 3-Stage and putting the Swirl Beta fixture in the middle with the bot in front. Stage left and right had everything removed with the walls painted black. In June / July 2021 Kedzie repainted the side stages purple and installed the Light up posters from {{< wiki-link "Matteson, IL (106 Town Center Rd)" >}} Circle of Lights. The light up posters have a color loop and are not programmed with the show. Also, around this time Kedzie also got the TV Light fixtures from Avon, IN (9931 E US Hwy 36) and had them in the back of the show room eventually installing next to the Beta swirl between August - October 2021. In August 2024, the stage would be removed for a 2.0 remodel, marking the end of the short-lived CU Beta 16M stage type in stores.

### Nomenclature

This is one of the only stage shows in CEC to not have a proper identifier given, which lead to many names being given to this stage show by fans; ranging from 'Beta 16m 3-Stage', '3 stage/Studio C hybrid', to the name popularized by YouTube user Cyclone, 'Studio 3'.(1)(2) The 'Studio 3' handle is derived of the Studio 'C' props and animatronic CEC characters being present on a 3-Stage platform. The usage of Beta in some of these stage names come from the fan name for the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, that of which has an internal name of 'Studio 'C' 2000'.

## Design

The design for both CU Beta 16m stages are different for {{< wiki-link "Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}} but the consistent design is re-using the 3-Stages from the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}} Stage Left and Right would be completely emptied of all branding of the former stage with it then either being blocked off by curtains or having random things installed to fill the space. Center stage would have the 16m bot installed in the center with the Beta Spiral installed behind the animatronic. To the left and right of Beta Swirl would be the Beta TV Light fixtures. Some stores kept the three stage buildings and planters from the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}} or had them completely removed leaving only the beta themed props. The spotlight would be reusing the guitar spot light with the ceiling floods being the same ones from the center stage.
