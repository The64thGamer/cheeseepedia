<b><i>The Rock-afire Simulator</b></i> is an in-development official Creative Engineering animatronics simulator, set to be released in 2025 or 2026.
<h2>History</h2> 
The simulator would be a successor project to {{< wiki-link "The Rock-afire Explosion Simulator" >}} from 2020, which was a Kickstarter project that did not receive its required funding due to the prior fangame release of {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Replay" >}} taking the spotlight from the project. While the initial development would cease around early 2021, Creative Engineering would still tout wanting to eventually have an official simulator.
<br>
Communication over the successor project would begin with CEI and its soon to be lead, BattleXGamer2, would begin in late 2022. Unofficial plans and prototyping would begin in early 2023, with things being officially set into motion by 2024. Showcases of the simulator have appeared on the members-only {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering Premium Video Service" >}}, though most public statements of the simulator have been brief and vague- as it is still in development.
<h2>Overview</h2>
Multiple features are confirmed for the simulator:
<ul>
<li>Watch the entire library of The Rock-afire Explosions showtapes</li>
<li>Program songs on The Rock-afire Explosion</li>
<li>Export your programmed showtapes to {{< wiki-link "CEI .wav Files" >}} so you can watch them on a Real Show</li>
