The <b><i>Mitzi Cyberstar Walkaround</b></i> was a walkaround used exclusively for <i>Cyberstar</i> videos at the {{< wiki-link "Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}.
The walkaround was produced by J&M Costumers, alongside the other costumes used in the Cyberstar videos.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> Variants </h2>
The First version was a pretty accurate Mitzi. The way you would be able to see out of the costume was through the eyes and possibly nose and mouth.
The Second version was the one that actually got used. In this version however, Mitzi's face is alot more rounder and her eyes are bigger and blue. Her ears don't stay up like the other one.
