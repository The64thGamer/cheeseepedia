***Chuck E. Cheese Adventure World*** is a 2025 spinoff chain of {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's" >}} that first launched on November 7th, 2025.

## History

### Pre-Opening

The first location would be registered with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation on June 30th, 2025, marked as 'CHUCKE'S ADVENTURE WORLD' and 'ARCADES & ENTERTAINMENT CENTER'. The project was set to have already started on June 1st, and was set to complete by November 1st of the same year. The cost of the project was estimated at $800,000. This info wouldn't be known by the public until much later. {{< cite 7 >}}

The first mention of Adventure World would from a limited email survey sent out on July 17th, 2025, which would state: {{< cite 1 >}}

> "We're creating a new attraction aimed at kids between the ages of 3-8 years of age. We can't tell you much about it now, but it will be really fun, energetic, imaginative, and entertaining. This won't be a Chuck E. Cheese, but it will still feature Chuck E. Cheese characters and will be just as fun."

The survey would go on to feature a set of logos for participants to choose from based on preference. It would also ask "How different is this logo from other places you might take your kids? (like Chuck E. Cheese, Urban Air, Main Event, etc)", and "What type of attraction would you expect to see this logo on?"- with options for "Indoor playground, Birthday party place, Bowling alley, Restaurant, Arcade, Interactive museum". Shortly after this, employee communications would reveal that the internal plans were to have it like a Chuck E. Cheese location, but without an arcade and featuring the Adventure Zone, which consists of Chuck E.'s Superhero Playground and the Trampoline Zone. It would also be communicated that the {{< wiki-link "Brandon, FL (1540 W Brandon Blvd)">}} store would be the designated store used to sell around the idea. {{< cite 2 >}}

On July 21st, Adventure World would make an apperance on the Promoted Companies website, represented by PC to look for valid real-estate in the Dallas Fort-Worth area, with site requirements of 12,000-18,000 sqft. AI generated concept art would show a building with slides, ball-pits, and indoor playgrounds adorned with CEC branding. A mock up of a building showing what the exterior design would look like was also shown, later found out to be of the first planned location in Arlington, TX. {{< cite 3 >}}

On August 3rd, another survey would be sent out going over the same choosing of a logo, but this time it would feature a variety of different styles and arrangements, including AI generated renders of Chuck E. in a new outfit. {{< cite 4 >}} {{< cite 5 >}} On August 15th, CEC would do a press release for Adventure World, confirming a location in Arlington, TX with around 12,000 sqft. would open in early November, with 5-6 additional stores planned to open in 2026. {{< cite 6 >}} The same day, it would be discovered on the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation that the store's info was posted, located at {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (1536 W Interstate 20)" >}}, registered from June 30th of that year. {{< cite 7 >}}

Throughout October and early November multiple showings of the location, alongside an Adventure World page popping up on the CEC website, would show more changes done from a typical CEC location. They would confirm that the AI generated art as rumored would be directly used in all promotional material. The main food area would now become 'Pasqually's Snack Shop' which offered pretzels, churros, popcorn, and other items. The rest of the location would consist of a large play structure, claw machines, seating areas, a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}, and a {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}.{{< cite 8 >}} CEC would also film a commercial for Adventure World in early november. A few days later a fully AI generated commercial would instead appear across all CEC locations.

### Opening

The {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (1536 W Interstate 20)" >}} would open on November 7th at 3pm. The previous controversies surrounding the use of AI art at the location however would cause a mass of negative reviews to flood the Google Maps page for the location, which would then devolve into CEC corporate employees writing their own positive reviews to boost the numbers. A mass flood of 5-star reviews would then hit the page on November 8th, before eventually the entire reviews section was wiped and disabled from the location.{{< cite 17 >}}
