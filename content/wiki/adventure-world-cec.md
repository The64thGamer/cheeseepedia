***Chuck E. Cheese Adventure World*** is an upcoming 2025 spinoff chain of {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's" >}}.

# History

The first mention of Adventure World would from a limited email survey sent out on July 17th, 2025, which would state: {{< cite 1 >}}

> "We're creating a new attraction aimed at kids between the ages of 3-8 years of age. We can't tell you much about it now, but it will be really fun, energetic, imaginative, and entertaining. This won't be a Chuck E. Cheese, but it will still feature Chuck E. Cheese characters and will be just as fun."

The survey would go on to feature a set of logos for participants to choose from based on preference. It would also ask "How different is this logo from other places you might take your kids? (like Chuck E. Cheese, Urban Air, Main Event, etc)", and "What type of attraction would yo expect to see this logo on?"- with options for "Indoor playground, Birthday party place, Bowling alley, Restaurant, Arcade, Interactive museum".

Shortly after this, employee communications would reveal that the internal plans are to have it like a Chuck E. Cheese location, but without an arcade and featuring the Adventure Zone, which consists of Chuck E.'s Superhero Playground and the Trampoline Zone. It would also be communicated that the {{< wiki-link "Brandon, FL (1540 W Brandon Blvd)">}} store would be the designated store used to sell around the idea. {{< cite 2 >}}

On July 21st, Adventure World would make an apperance on the Promoted Companies website, represented by PC to look for valid real-estate in the Dallas Fort-Worth area, with site requirements of 12,000-18,000 sqft. AI generated concept art would show a building with slides, ball-pits, and indoor playgrounds adorned with CEC branding. {{< cite 3 >}}

On August 3rd, another survey would be sent out going over the same choosing of a logo, but this time it would feature a variety of different styles and arrangements, including AI generated renders of Chuck E. in a new outfit. {{< cite 4 >}} {{< cite 5 >}}
