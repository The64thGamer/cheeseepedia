The **Bird Animatronic** is an animatronic figure created by Garner Holt Productions Inc. for Chuck E. Cheese's locations from 1997 to 2002 The bot is a mostly green parrot with wings that are red, orange, and yellow sitting on a perch. He was only installed on the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} and Studio C Prototype stage.

## History

The {{< wiki-link "Studio C" >}} concept originally debuted in December of 1997 as a brand-new show idea intended originally to replace all Munch's Make Believe Band stages which featured one Chuck E. animatronic, and a little parrot named Bird. This setup was called the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}, and featured Chuck E. and Bird in a late night talk show studio, complete with a light-up desk, a 'Pizza Time' clock, a pizza phone, an {{< wiki-link "Interactive Console" >}}, and a Blue Screen with a camera. The bird was later included in the Studio C Prototype stage. This stage featured Bird on a taller perch than what was on the Studio C Alpha. This stage would be the last to feature Bird though, as future iterations of Studio C would not feature him.

The bot features 4 movements in total.
