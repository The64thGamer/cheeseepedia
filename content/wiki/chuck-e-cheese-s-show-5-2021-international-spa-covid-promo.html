<h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Chuck E. & Friends - “The Holiday Party” was written by Eric Neal as a request from Matt Daniel. Neal, enjoying old school hip-hop, created the song in a similar vein to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_What%27cha_Want"> 'So What'Cha Want'</a> by the Beastie Boys.</li><li>Munch & Munch - “The Windowsill” was also written by Matt Daniel as a new Munch song. The song was a nod to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby,_It%27s_Cold_Outside"> Baby It's Cold Outside</a>, being an idea Matt had, along with an idea for Munch to struggle with his conscience in song, for around for a few years. Someone in the entertainment department eventually came up with theming the song around the holidays, and with a new Munch puppet being created around the same time, Matt went ahead with the creation of the song.</li><li>On the DVD Menu for Munch's Make Believe Band set up it says 'Show 5, 2020' instead of 'Show 5 2021'</li><li>Hidden at the end of the Studio C SD copy of Show 5, 2021 shows a clip of 'Merry Christmastime' slowed down and playing backwards for varying amounts of time. The reason behind this is to keep the length of every Studio C show the same length.</li><li>The Ryan's World Intermissions were removed and replaced with 30 seconds of the Winter Winner-land logo with instrumentals playing. First time it plays the instrumentals for 'Toyland' plays, For the second time it plays the instrumentals 'Let's Play Some Games for the Holidays' play.</li><li>This was the first showtape played at the Puerto Rico stores after getting International shows.</li><li>Despite Cyberamic stages existing in international locations, the only copies of this show that were released were for Studio C and WEIGL locations.</li></ul>
