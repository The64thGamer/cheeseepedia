<b><i>19125 W Bluemound Road, Store #841</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 17, 1997, with a Studio C Alpha and is still open to this day undergoing the 2.0 remodel.

<h2>Stages</h2>
Brookfield opened with a Studio C Alpha, the very first of its kind. In the early-mid 2000s, the Late-Night outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit. Around when the 2005 remodel came around, they removed the interactive console, the blue screen, the Apple TV, installed the ticket blaster, and removed the Cool Chuck outfit for the Avenger outfit. In mid-late 2013, Chuck's cap was removed, and in 2017, their curtains would be disabled. In late 2019 after the Appleton, WI stage was removed the valve board would be sent to replace the Brookfield, WI original. The Stage was removed on August 12th, 2024 for the Dance Floor and the Video Wall

<h2> History</h2>
Brookfield opened on December 17, 1997, with the Phase 2 remodel. This included some late '90s decor, Skytubes, and the very first Studio C Alpha. Brookfield remained like this for many years. In 2012, Brookfield received the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative|2005 remodel, which involved removing all '90s decor for newer decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, changing the exterior, and removing the dim lighting for brighter lighting. They were also on a street called Cheese E. Street. A unique road sign was created with the Thumb Chuck above it and below it reading 'Cheese E. Street' on the standard green and white road sign color scheme. The street sign was removed in Spring 2022 and was saved by a private collector. The pole for the sign still remains. The 2.0 remodel for this location started on August 12th, 2024, by removing their very first Studio C Alpha stage.
