The **Italy 1991** was a decor piece found at Chuck E Cheese Location’s released in 1991. 

This would be one of the first Chuck E Cheese’s posters during the Concept Unification Era, this would later be reused in 2001 when all of the 1991 posters would get updated to match the Avenger Era art style. 

## Appearance 

This decor piece featured Pasqually the Chef taking a photo next to the leaning tower of Pisa, Pasqually would also be looking to the left with him holding a Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza Box.
