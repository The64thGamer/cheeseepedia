<b><i>Choo Choo</b></i> is one of the prop characters in the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}, having made his debut as an animatronic at {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
<h3> Origins & ShowBiz Pizza Place </h3>
Choo Choo was a direct copy of the character 'Choo Choo' from the {{< wiki-link "Hard Luck Bears" >}}. He would move up and down to the songs, and sat in a log next to {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue" >}}. He was only acknowledged once by the band in the Trivia Night showtape. During {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, several Choo Choos would be retrofitted into Munch Jr.
<h3> Present Day </h3>
Original parts for Choo Choo would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
