***Antioch*** is one of the prop characters in the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}, having made his debut as an animatronic at {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}.

## History

### Origins &amp; ShowBiz Pizza Place

Antioch was originally referred to as the Birthday Spider, and held a cake in-between his hands. Over time, he would become {{< wiki-link "Fatz Geronimo (Animatronic)" >}}'s pet spider. He would pop down occasionally and speak to Fatz in a garbled language that only they could understand. During {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, Antioch would be destroyed. Antioch was named after the first ShowBiz Pizza Place location in {{< wiki-link "Kansas City, MO (2726 NE Vivion Rd)" >}}.

### Present Day

Original parts for Antioch would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
