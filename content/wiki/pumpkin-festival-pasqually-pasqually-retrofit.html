<b><i>Pumpkin Festival Pasqually</b></i> is a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Pasqually (Cyberamic)" >}} at <i>Burger Farm & Garden Center</i> in Cincinnati, Ohio. (7849 Main St. (RT 32), Cincinnati, OH 45244)
The bot can only be seen when the location has its annual Fall Pumpkin Festival, in which it and other <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> retrofits will be displayed as props for decoration from the last week of September through the end of October. None of them are hooked up in any way to be movable, with all cylinders and air hoses removed.
Pasqually is displayed in a room with Jasper and Chuck, often trading positions each year. They are decorated with wheat stalks, pumpkins, gourds, rags, a vase, and sit on haybales. Each have a general farmer theme to their outfits, complimenting the decorations.
<h2> Design </h2>
Pasqually is dressed and changed to look like a farm boy. Notably, his mustache is replaced with a much smaller mustache which is glued to the mask. His jaw had facial hair glued to it. As for the outfit, Pasqually now wears a large yellow hat. A long-sleeve plaid shirt wraps up his body, with denim overalls on top. A new handkerchief was added around his neck as well. Finally, a guitar was put between his hands.
