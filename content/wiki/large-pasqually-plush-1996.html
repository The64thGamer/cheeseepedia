<h2>Design</h2>
The plush has a round body with two fat cylindrical legs connected to it. The plush has round arms with mitten-like hands. The plush's head has a sunken in chin, a big round nose, two ears that look like a folded circle. It's two eyes are squares that are rounded out at the top with printed black details to represent his eyebrows and pupils. The plush's mustache is nicely shaped but is ruined by the fuzzy material used on the mustache and hair. A red mouth is featured under the mustache. The plush's shoes are nicely detailed with white and black fabric and blue-ribbon shoelaces and his pants are black. He has a red striped shirt under his apron. His apron has been made smaller compared to the previously released 1992 and 1994 plushies to make room for his poseable legs. He has a sewn neckerchief that can be untied and removed. He also has a white chef's hat with the same red striped pattern on its brim as it was on his shirt.
Its tag reads as <b>'Chuck E. Cheese's</b> © 1996 ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. Made in China'. The back reads as ALL NEW MATERIAL Contents: Polyester Fiber ОН 17389 РА 5081 MA 1340 ME 3658 Dennis Foland, Inc. San Jose, CA'.
<h3>Differences Between Small Size</h3>
This plush and it's {{< wiki-link "Small Pasqually Plush (1996)" >}} are nearly identical. Everything on the larger plush is more proportionate as every design element is larger. For example, the fuzziness on the mustache and hair is toned down and his arms don't look as inflated.
