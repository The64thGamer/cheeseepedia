***'Cupid Shuffle 2012'*** was a road show which was first released in September 2012 on the {{< wiki-link "Road Show 2012" >}} CD, which was a redub of {{< wiki-link "Cupid Shuffle" >}} with Jaret Reddick as Chuck E. Cheese. It would make its live show debut exclusively on Weigl stages for the remainder of 2012. It would then be released for Studio C and Existing Stages in January 2013.

## Summary

### Edits
The video for this live show would receive numerous edits. The initial release features only the Michael Hill footage from the original and the ‘Chuck E. Live’ logo from Havin’ A Party 2001. In January 2013, the ‘Chuck E. Live’ logo would be replaced, and a new ‘Cupid Shuffle’ graphic would be added at the beginning. In December 2013, Existing Stages would receive a new edit that re-adds the footage of Chuck E. from the original version, while Studio C locations would revert to the 2012 edit. This live show would only be programmed for Studio C and Circles of Light stages.

### Countdowns
In September 2012 and December 2013, this live show would be accompanied by a five-minute countdown featuring Michael Hill occasionally talking to the audience. 

In January 2013, this countdown would be changed to a countdown that starts with Hard Hat Hank introducing Chuck E. Someone off-screen then informs Hank that Chuck E. won’t be ready for another five minutes. Hank then tells Pasqually to come out and sing to fill time, and Pasqually sings a parody of the ‘Trololo’ song, counting down the minutes until the live show. 

In April 2013, the countdown would be replaced again. This countdown begins with a 10-second countdown for the countdown to Chuck E. Cheese live. This would then be followed by a combination of both previous countdowns, with the ‘Trololo’ instrumental playing throughout.
