Chuckmore poster; 1991 Postcard posters (Pasqually's Italy and Jasper's Wild West); Cheese Guitar sign; 1993 Salad Bar, Beverages and Round Coach Chuck signs; 1991 Confetti Portraits; and other misc signage.
In 2000, St. Charles would remodel once again to Phase 3, this time removing the 3-Stage for a Studio C Alpha; receiving one of the first Studio C stages in Missouri.
In around 2008, St. Charles would remodel to the 2005 remodel; removing the 90's decorations, knocking down the Showroom walls, removing the balcony seating, & adding purple walls. Chuck's outfit was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit not long after that.
