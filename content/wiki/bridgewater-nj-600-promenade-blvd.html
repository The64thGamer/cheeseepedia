<h2> History </h2>
Bridgewater Promenade had plans to open a new CEC in the plaza from August 1999. However, the CEC did not open until the following year when the store officially opened on February 7, 2000. The store opened with the thumb chuck exterior, showroom walls, MustCTV posters, late 90s decor, Toddler Zone, {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}, and the Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha. Bridgewater was the first CEC to open in New Jersey with a Studio C and the first non-existing stage store in NJ. When Bridgewater opened, the animatronic had the late night outfit until 2004-2007 when they received the blue Cool Chuck shirt and khakis.
In the late 2000s, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing the MustCTV posters for the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} posters, raising the brightness and installing fluorescent lighting throughout the restaurant, removing the showroom walls, painting walls purple, removing all 90s decor for current artwork, and replacing the tables and counters with red booths. Similar to Princeton, Bridgewater kept the thumb chuck exterior they had since opening after the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} remodel for years following the remodel. The animatronic received the full avenger outfit with the purple cap, shirt, and green shorts between late 2012 and Summer 2013. However, the shirt they received was for the 3-Stage animatronic and not the Studio C bot for some unknown reason. When they initially put the shirt on the bot, some of the mech was exposed due to the shirt not fitting. His avenger cap was removed in September 2013.
In December 2016, the Skytubes were trashed and replaced with a Giraffe Ride. Around late 2018, the Phase 3 exterior and awnings were removed for the updated Phase 5 logo and purple awnings. This would leave the Princeton store being the last store in NJ with the Thumb Chuck exterior until it's 2.0 remodel in 2024. On March 19, 2024, news would spread around about the location's closure in April. The location closed permanently on April 7, 2024 and the last interactive console in the world was removed (having been salvaged by a former employee), marking it's extinction.
