***Captain Andy*** is the character that was named after the show.

## History

He was created by Bob Gurr(1), most likely with the company Sequoia Creative, Inc., which he co-founded for the restaurant chain called Captain Andy River Towne, which opened its first location in 1982(2). In 1984, Animated Playhouses Corporation, the company that owned the show, filed for bankruptcy and closed all the restaurants.(3) The only show that still operated to this day was first sold in 1984 to Thorpe Park in Chertsey, where they performed from 1985 to 1996. Then they were sold to Pleasurewood Hills in Lowestoft, where they operated until 2002. Then they were bought by Richard Haines for Watermouth Castle in Ilfracombe, but the show needed to be rewired and reprogrammed because all of them were in bad shape.(4)
