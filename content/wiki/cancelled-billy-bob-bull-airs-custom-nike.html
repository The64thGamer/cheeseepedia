The <b><i>Billy Bob Bull-Airs Custom Nike</b></i> was a cancelled product set to launch in 2025 after the Chuck E. Cheese Bull-Airs line. 

<h2>History</h2>
Bull-Airs would reveal a Billy Bob SneakerHeadz used for the shoe on January 16th, teasing the potential collaboration. Later on January 20th Bull-Airs claimed they could not acquire the Rock-afire license from Creative Engineering, but did not state the reason why it was declined. Later on images for the shoe would leak online.
