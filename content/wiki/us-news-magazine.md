The **U.S. News (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Uncle Sam (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Uncle Sam outfit with the U.S. themed hat & tuxedo. This magazine is a parody of the 1917 army poster 'I WANT YOU FOR U.S. ARMY' that features Uncle Sam.
