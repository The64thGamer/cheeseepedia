Long fur arms have been around since the very start. Arms were made to pair with these outfits, red vest, basketball jersey, cool chuck, purple chuck attire. The fur used is 2-inch pile gray frost faux fur. Long fur arms for the Chuck E. Cheese walkaround were discontinued in 2005 in favor of making all accessories short fur to fall in line with the new 2005 model Chuck E. Cheese.
