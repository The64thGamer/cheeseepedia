<b><i>10 Wall St, Store #488</b></i> was a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} in Burlington, Massachusetts. The location opened August 4, 1992, and closed July 16, 2017. The store was located in an unnamed plaza.
<h2> History </h2>
Burlington opened in an unnamed plaza on August 4th, 1992; two weeks before {{< wiki-link "Worcester, MA (50 Southwest Cutoff)" >}}. This was the second 2-Stage installed in the New England region and first in Massachusetts. Unlike many of them at the time, this location had Jasper's banjo, like Worcester.
In 1994/1995, They received a remodel and got the {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} game package, adding the Thumb Chuck exterior they had until closing.
In November 2001, Burlington added a Toddler Zone. Then they got rid of the Ball Crawl sometime in 2002. In the summer of the same year, Chuck's Tuxedo & Derby was replaced with the Cool Chuck outfit.
In 2004, they replaced the former side curtains with lift curtains.
In late 2008, Burlington received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} which removed the showroom wall(s), the balcony seating, painted several walls purple, replaced the dim lighting with brighter florescent supermarket lighting, and replaced the record/album parody posters with posters of kids smiling. The exterior was left intact due to the plaza owners being strict.
In early 2012, The curtains were removed, Helen got a new mask and wig, and they received 2 new Flat Screen TVs hanging from the ceiling.
In early 2013, the Cool Chuck shorts were replaced with the Avenger shorts. Chuck's cap was then removed in September of the same year.
In late 2015-early 2016, the original screen between Chuck E and Helen was replaced with a modern flat screen; then they received the Play Pass later that year.
On June 26th, 2017, the store announced that they would close due to leasing issues.
Finally on July 16th, 2017, Burlington was permanently closed. As of 2024, it's now X Golf center.
