<h2>History</h2>
Pico Rivera opened sometime in 1982. Unfortunately, there is hardly any information about when it was a PTT, but they had a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. Pico Rivera had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80s when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Balcony Stage for the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} and added new decor. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} removed the 1988 Remodel decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the installation of the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} between 2008-2009 when they removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocated the 2-Stage. In 2010, the 2-Stage was converted into a 1-Stage. In March 2024, Pico Rivera began their {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, removing their 1-Stage not long after for a 2021 Model Dance Floor. The store would also receive the Trampoline Zone Package. As of April 2024, Pico Rivera still has the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}
