In 1980, The location appeared in a Channel 40 local Sacramento news broadcast<ref name=':1'>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/ptt/ptt_pizzatimes-1980.pdf</ref>.

The location closed in January 1985 for unknown reasons with an auction also being held on January 12th 1985. It is unknown why Citrus Heights (Greenback) closed but one possible reason could be competition from the {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)" >}} which was only 3 minutes away. Another possible reason is that it may had been under-performing, a reason for many closures around this time. The site is now a Save on Cleaners.
