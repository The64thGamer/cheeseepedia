***Whac-A-Munch*** was a modified version of the original Whac-A-Mole cabinet exclusive to Chuck E. Cheese's from an unknown set of years, presumed around the early 90's with one cabinet showing a January 10, 1992 serial number.


### Variants

Each cabinet seen of Whac-A-Munch features multiple different color schemes and styles. Early Whac-A-Mole cabinets are distinguished by being in double or triple machine setups, while later variants mostly showed up as singles. Later units also had arcade buttons used instead of incandecent bulbs as to remove the issue of the lights being hit by the hammers.
