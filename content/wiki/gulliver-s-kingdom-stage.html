Gulliver's Kingdom has a retrofitted {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} renamed to 'Hard Luck Bears' located in the The Liliput Land Theatre, the character positioning is the same to the original Rock-afire Explosion set-up except the characters themselves feature different clothing and all have replacement bear masks.
The stage itself features the usual 3-stage design however with a large rectangular platform in front and 2 water fountains embedded within, the characters Antioch and Choo Choo are not on the main stage and are instead located on the rectangular stage in front, Looney Bird also used to be located under this stage<sup>(1)</sup> but was moved to Billy Bob's stage with the shows restoration.
Billy Bob and Looney Bird's stage has the Antioch cloud as Antioch no longer needs it, Rolfe and Earl's stage has a platform behind the character with a rotating automation band made up of foxes and a frog created by Heimotion these automations used to be on all the time but are now connected to a flood light signal.<sup>(2)</sup> Rolfe's stage also features a modified version of the rainbow prop with a beehive and honey pot instead of pots of gold.
<h2> History </h2>
The show was installed in 1995 and ran off the original Greybox control system created by Creative Engineering Inc, the show also came with an original showtape; produced by Gulliver's and programmed by Creative Engineering Inc; sometime within the 2000's this was changed out to a new control system where Gulliver's staff would program the new showtapes by themselves. The show in this state stopped being shown publically in 2016.
<h3> Restoration </h3>
On 27 February 2022 Instagram user 'xan_rock_afire_fan' announced that he would be restoring all 3 of Gulliver's Hard Luck Bears shows.<sup>(3)</sup> The restoration included a full mechanical restoration, a switch to the 'BlueBox' control system, Looney Bird being relocated to the Rock-afire standard position and the shows lights being switched over to LED lights, with only the spotlights staying as the original halogen lights.
The show room got a repaint and artwork of the characters designed by Instagram user 'rockafire_guy' painted on the back walls.<sup>(4)</sup>
This show as of now plays original Rock-afire Explosion showtapes as well as fan made showtapes and runs regularly with every open day of the park Gulliver's will sometimes run fan conventions<sup>(5)</sup> <sup>(6)</sup>for the show and the other animatronics in their parks.
