Vista, CA (1861 University Dr) opened in mid-late 2006 as a Chuck E. Cheese’s with the 2005 update to the 2003 cool Chuck reconfigureation (phase 4) with a Studio C 2000 stage with a 16m bot wearing cool Chuck attire and mostly stayed the same throughout the early 2000’s and 2010’s except for the removal of the sky tubes and the removal of the cool Chuck cap and later adding full rockstar attire onto the Chuck bot. In 2019 the store would get the new at the time 2.0 remodel getting rid of the studio c beta in favor for a 2019 model dance floor. In 2020 Vista along with a bunch of other locations at the time would close permanently following the company’s bankruptcy. The space that was once Chuck E Cheese is now a Trader Joe’s as of April 2025
