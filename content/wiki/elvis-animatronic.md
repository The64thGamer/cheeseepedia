***Elfis*** is Santa's only rock 'n' rebel.

## History

Originally, Elfis was planned to be on a balcony on the left side of the stage, but it was later changed to appear in the middle(1), he was then installed in 1977 in Santa's Village (Jefferson, New Hampshire) by creative engineerin (2) for the first full show that they developed, where he operated until 2015/2016. In 2006, the animatronics were replaced by ones created by Advanced Animations, but the showtape wasn't replaced.(3)

## Design

He is an elf that was inspired by Elvis Presley, wearing a leather jacket with a white shirt and slicked-back black hair.
