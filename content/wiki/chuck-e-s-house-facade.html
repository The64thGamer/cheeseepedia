<b></b>Chuck E.'s House Facade' (C-Stage)<i></i>' was a prefabricated false front which, when applied over an existing {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}, transforms it into a house.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> History </h2>
'Chuck E.â€™s House Facade' supposedly debuted at the {{< wiki-link "San Antonio, TX (8220 Windsor Cross)" >}} location in 1988-1989 and went extinct in 2003 when the {{< wiki-link "Tacoma, WA (4911 Tacoma Mall Blvd)" >}} location replaced the facade for Studio C. The Facade would end up becoming the last stage created with the Pizza Time Players positioning-- as the next stage to be produced, the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}, introduced Munch's Make-Believe Band.
<h2> Design </h2>
This stage kept the same concept as the Balcony Stage; however, it was now themed to be a house-like setting.
Behind four of the characters sat horizontal siding with windows with lighting behind a pane. The base of which the characters and windows sat had a wall of horizontal siding or railing in front of the original Balcony Stage front with lattice directly under it.
The faux valence of the stage became a shingled roof with popcorn lights above Munch, Chuck E., & Pasqually.
Some installations had a live stage instead of the lattice (some had the distinct 'C', and some didn't). It featured checkered flooring, fencing, and steps to get up.
