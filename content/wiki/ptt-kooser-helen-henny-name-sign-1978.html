The <b><i>1978 Helen Henny Name Sign</b></i> made its only appearance at the second Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre located on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} in the Blossom Hill Shopping Center in San Jose, California; where it took the role of identifying the Kooser Helen Henny animatronic from November 1978 to May, 1980.
<h2> Production </h2>
While no specific data is documented on the production of the earlier Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre signage outside of speculation, we can assume Helen Hennys nameplate was produced simultaneously in a single batch along with the other Kooser nameplates shortly before or after the production of the main Kooser Portrait Show at Fantasy Forest Manufacturing. If production was not carried about by Fantasy Forest Manufacturing, it can be under assumption that it was either produced by a contracting company, or by Pizza Time Theatre Incorporated themselves.
Once production was completed, each nameplate, including Helen Hennys, was most likely sent out in November 1978 for preparation for the opening of the 1371 Kooser Road store; which would be the worlds largest pizza parlor at the time.
<h2> Usage </h2>
The Kooser Helen Henny Nameplate was only used at the 1371 Kooser Road location placed under the Kooser Helen Henny animatronic for the purpose of identifying it from as early as November 1978, where it was used until May 1980, where it was ultimately taken out alongside the Kooser Portrait Show.  Once the nameplate had completed its run, several scenarios could have played out, those being:<ul><li><b>A.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and thrown out.</i></li><li><b>B.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and destroyed.</i></li><li><b>C.</b> <i>The nameplate was placed in one of several storage rooms at the 1371 Kooser Road location and auctioned off.</i></li><li><b>D.</b> <i>The nameplate was sent to the 1213 Innsbruck Drive corporate office in Sunnyvale, California, alongside the Kooser Portrait Animatronics.</i></li></ul>
<h2> Design </h2>
Helen Hennys nameplate used a rounded, brown wooden board as a base with the yellow text 'HELEN HENNY' placed directly in the center of the board, enclosed in a thin border of the same color with supporting bolts on each side of the text.<ol><li>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/promo/ptt/ptt_78kooser.pdf</li><li>https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/cec/ptt_79replay.pdf</li><li>https://www.showbizpizza.com/photos/cec/tx_hq01/index.html</li><li>https://youtu.be/4tgH_eThNZI</li></ol>
