***Country Helen*** is a standard Pizza Time Theatre showtape covering a selection of country songs with Helen Henny, and the first showtape to feature Scott Wilson as the voice of Chuck E. Cheese.
As all Country Helen tapes lack any sort of date on their label, it is unclear when this tape was put out during the year.
