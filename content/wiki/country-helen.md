***Country Helen* is a standard Pizza Time Theatre showtape covering a selection of country songs with guest star Helen Henny.
This was the only new main-stage showtape to release in 1984, as this was during the Pizza Time Theatre/ShowBiz company merger period. Due to the lack of other releases, along with all Country Helen tapes lacking any sort of date on their label, it is unclear when this tape was put out during the year.**
