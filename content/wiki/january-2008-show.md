The same thing was attempted previously for the {{< wiki-link "April 2007 Show" >}}. Cast members were to record videos of themselves lip-syncing to the song whilst doing their job. The deadline for submissions was October 29th, 2007. {{< wiki-link "Atlanta, GA (2990 Cumberland Blvd)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Fayetteville, GA (786 Glynn St)" >}} were chosen and featured in the video for 'Takin' Care of Business'.
