***Original Dreams: Songs From Showbiz*** was a Rock-afire Explosion cassette purchasable from Terror Vision's website on April 13, 2025, being a different format to the Record Store Day exclusive release of the [vinyl album](<>).

Only 500 CD units were produced. The front and back cover of the album remain unchanged on the CD release, however the interior features significantly less artwork than the vinyl releases. The disc itself has an image of The Rock-afire Explosion in the studio, originally taken for *Gee, Our 1st Album!*, and the band's logo can be seen in the compartment behind it.
