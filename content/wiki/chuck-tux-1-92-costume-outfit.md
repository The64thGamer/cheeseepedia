1992 introduced a new version of the classic gold tuxedo. This time the tux vest and pants are made by an actual tuxedo manufactured that cowan costumes would custom order from. This tuxedo is a golden dark brown chocolate velvet color, has a gold cummerbund and gold lapels. This tux is more form fitting than previous tux's.
