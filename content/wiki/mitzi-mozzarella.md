***Mitzi Mozzarella*** is one of the main characters of the ShowBiz Pizza Place franchise, having made her debut as an animatronic at {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}.

## History

### Origins

Mitzi Mozzarella was based off of the character Mini Mozzarella from the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}}. She borrowed her voice, and had a similar appearance. She had a cheerleader outfit, as well as blonde hair. She got her first animatronic in {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}. She was a youthful mouse, who was one of the lead vocalists for the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}.

### ShowBiz Pizza Place

Initially, Mitzi Mozzarella was voiced by Aaron Fechter. This version of the character was short lived, and had a much higher pitched voice. Mitzi soon got her permanent voice actor, Shalisa Sloan James. Mitzi would be portrayed as a stereotypical teenage girl, and would describe herself as liking boys, cars, and more. She is the only character to have canonically aged, with her birthday being January 1st, 1971. The last time her age was ever mentioned was in the {{< wiki-link "SPP New Years '88" >}} show, where she turned 17. Her and {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}} would almost receive second generation animatronics in 1983, with hers focusing on better movements for dancing and a new red/white outfit, but they were never mass produced.

### The New Rock-afire Explosion

After {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, Creative Engineering wanted to find a new way to bring the Rock-afire Explosion back into the public spotlight. They developed the New Rock-afire Explosion. Every character was changed, including Mitzi. Mitzi was now portrayed as older, and wore a black dress.

### Present Day

Mitzi's voice actor returned throughout the 21st century to make new songs. In these new shows, it was clear that Mitzi was a lot different than her Original youthful self. Original parts for Mitzi would start to be reproduced by Creative Engineering's new employees in 2023.
