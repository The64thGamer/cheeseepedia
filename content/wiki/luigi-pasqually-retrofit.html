<b><i>Luigi</b></i> was a retrofit of PTT Pasqually (Cyberamic) at <i>Jungle Jim's International Market</i> in Cincinnati, Ohio. (5440 Dixie Hwy, Fairfield, OH 45014)
The animatronic was originally able to be seen in the 'International Foods' section of the grocery store. He was revealed to the public on September 11, 1995, as part of a 68,000 square foot expansion until eventually being removed in 2002-2003.
<h2> History </h2>
Luigi originally came from the {{< wiki-link "Cincinnati, OH (11400 Princeton Pike)" >}} Pizza Time Theatre and was bought by Jungle Jim's after the location closed in the Fall of 1984. Luigi was first installed in 1995 in a stand in the Italy section of 'International Foods' his stand was labeled as 'Luigi Ristorante No One Cooks Like Luigi ' being made all out of wood with a small roof over the Cyberamic.
Cosmetically speaking Luigi's mask was reused from when he was at Pizza Time Theatre with the only change being the addition of eyebrows. He wears a chefs hat that is the size of his entire head. His outfit is a white shirt with a blue undershirt with a red handkerchief on top. Luigi would sing songs by Mario Lanza<sup>(1)</sup> Although it is currently unknown what he sang.
Luigi was replaced between 2002 - 2003 with Pedro who reused the stand, mask frame and white shirt with the blue undershirt.
<h2> Lost Media & Unknown information. </h2>
The only information related to what Luigi preformed is in an April 2002 article which stated 'At Luigi's Ristorante the crowd is serenaded by tenor Marion Lanza's famous voice'.<sup>(2)</sup>
As is with the rest of the animatronics installed he most likely had holiday tracks but those are also lost.
