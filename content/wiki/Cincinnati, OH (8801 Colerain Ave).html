<h2>History</h2>
The Colerain Ave Showbiz Pizza Place opened up November 11, 1981 opening in front of the former Gold Circle Mall as the 2nd Showbiz Pizza Store in Ohio (2nd after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}">Sharonville</a>). The store featured 'The Show Room, Sports Room, 60 Arcade games, a merry-go-round, and 'a magic cave'.' Fun Fact Colerain had unique showroom walls which unlike normal stores had an entrance in the middle of the wall. In 1982 apart of support for the Bengals getting into Super Bowl XVI Showbiz Pizza ran a promotion at Colerain & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}">Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)</a>. The event would happen January 24th in which you'd watch the event on a 'Wide Screen TV' and also bring in cans of soup in return 'Four Free Game Tokens and the soup goes to charity'. <sup><a href="6">6</a></sup>
In 1985 two events were held at the Showbiz one being the Greater Cincinnati Youth for Christ hosted a social on March 31st & June 16th from 8-11pm.

By 1987 Showbiz Pizza Place & Pizza Time Theatre had merged together with the ads beginning to reflect that. Since by that point every other SPP & PTT in the area had closed only Colerain & <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)" >}}">Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)</a> would be the only stores to show on these ads.<sup><a href="10">10</a></sup>
In 1989 The original Showbiz Pizza Place sign would be removed with the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza sign being installed in its place. Colerain would receive the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1988 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1988 Remodel Program</a> around the same time.
