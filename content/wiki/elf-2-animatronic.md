***Satchemo*** was the horn player from The Santa Claus Revue.

## History

Satchemo was installed in 1977 in Santa's Village (Jefferson, New Hampshire) by Creative Engineering (1) for the first full show that they developed, where he operated until 2015/2016. In 2006, the animatronics were replaced by ones created by Advanced Animations, but the showtape wasn't replaced. (2)

## Design

He is Elf with large eyes and bushy eyebrow; he wore a festive outfit with a Santa hat and was also holding a horn.

## Movements

## The animatronic got 5 movements, but during the remodeling, it lost 1 movement: the eye popped out, but, the leg got a tap movement during the remodeling. (3) | Movement | |-----------------| | Eyes | | Head Turn Right | | Head Turn Left | | Arms | | Body Turn up | | |
