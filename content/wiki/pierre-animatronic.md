Pierre LeBear was created for the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}} which was sold to Morey's Piers and Americana Amusement Park. His mech was later reused for Pete Thornsberry in the {{< wiki-link "Hard Luck Bears" >}}.

## History

Pierre along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<sup>(1)</sup> and currently resides at the CEI museum.

## Design

In his design for Americana Amusement Park, he wore a a collar and black bowtie. At Morey's Piers, he wore a red, paisley bowtie and blue vest.
