<h2> History </h2>
Houston opened on June 1, 1982 in the Village Place shopping center and had {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}. Unfortunately, barely any information on this store as a ShowBiz or in general falls into extreme scarcity. They later got the 1988 remodel, like most other locations. In 1991, the store received Concept Unification, being renamed to 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza', and the removal of The Rock-afire Explosion for a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}. The store would close without warning sometime in 1993 (month and day unknown) for unknown reasons. The location was split up into multiple businesses, until the early 2010s, when the entire Village Place mall was demolished for Joe V's Smart Shop. As of August 2023, Joe V's Smart Shop is still on the space.
