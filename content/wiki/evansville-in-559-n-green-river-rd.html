<h2>History</h2>
Evansville opened on December 21st, 1982, as the 8th ShowBiz Pizza Place in Indiana (8th after {{< wiki-link "Indianapolis, IN (8804 US 31 South)" >}}, Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41)|Terre Haute, {{< wiki-link "Mishawaka, IN (822 W McKinley Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Indianapolis, IN (8109 E Washington St)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Fort Wayne, IN (711 Coliseum Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Indianapolis, IN (5501 E 82nd St)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Indianapolis, IN (4910 W 38th St)" >}}) as a corporate-owned store. Evansville originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. Evansville would have it for a few years, until around 1991/1992, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor, adding the Blue and White awnings, and the checkers. In the mid 1990s, Evansville received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. Around the Late 90's, Evansville would receive the Phase 2 remodel, removing older decor for newer decor, removing Blue and White awnings, removed checkers, and adding SkyTubes and Toddler Zone. Evansville received the 2005 update to the 2003 Remodel in 2006-2007 replacing older decor with newer decor, removing Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, replacing the stage, removed Toddler Zone, and relocating some of the games, kitchen area, and SkyTubes. Evansville would remain like this until April 2022, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the Studio C Cappa stage and replacing it with a <a href="https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Live_Stage_(Dance_Floor)"> Dance Floor + Video Wall</a>. Currently, as of November 2023, Evansville still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.
<h2> Stages </h2>
