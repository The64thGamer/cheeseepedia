The ***Winchester Game Room Rules Sign* first appeared at the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} from May 1977 to potentially the 1981 remodel.**

## Production

Similarly to the restroom sign, the game room rules sign has very little information on the production of it, however, we can assume it was conceptualized as early as the production of 'The Big Cheese' floorplan. If not, it is most likely it was produced from the timespan of January 1977 to early May 1977, shortly before the store would open.

## Usage

The only known usage of the sign is at 370 South Winchester Boulevard, with no other units known to be shipped to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre units meaning it was most likely store specific.
The sign would be placed above the game room directly under {{< wiki-link "Winchester Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic)" >}}

## Design

The design of this sign varies from other known signs at the store, instead showcasing a brown background with red text layered on top of a second background, this time in the color yellow; the larger white text placed in between the 2 backgrounds reads 'NO' with smaller red text reading, 'FOOD OR SMOKING PERMITTED'
