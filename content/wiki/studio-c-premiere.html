<b><i>Studio C Premiere</b></i> was released in December 1997 and ran until September 1998.
This show was eventually modified and re-edited for MMBB stores with the {{< wiki-link "May 1998 Show" >}}.
<h2> DVCAM Footage </h2>
The first full footage of the show would be provided by Brian Hagan on December 21, 2021.<sup>(1)</sup> This was through a DVCAM recording of the show video spliced with recordings of the {{< wiki-link "Studio C" >}} stage performing the showtape. This recording would additionally be AI upscaled.
The footage would be copyright-striked minutes after upload, but was able to be downloaded before being pulled. The footage would be reuploaded multiple times with cut down segments, but improved video clarity.<sup>(2)</sup>
