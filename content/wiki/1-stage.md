The 1-Stage is a stage format found at Chuck E. Cheese locations, which either opened with the stage or replaced a previous stage from 1992 - 1998, 2011, and 2015. It was the last official Munch's Make Believe Band stage created. As of August 2025, 2 1-Stages remain, both in the United States.

## Appearance

### Mini Unit 1-Stage

The Mini Unit 1-Stage was the very first variation of the 1-Stage. It debuted at the Waldorf, Maryland location on March 24th, 1992. This stage version was specifically designed for a prototype 6,000 square-foot location CEC was testing for lower-density areas. It was officially dubbed a 'Mini Unit'. While it is mostly similar to the finalized design, the Mini Unit 1-Stage shares a few significant differences compared to the normal mass-produced 1-Stage design. It is the smallest 1-Stage design, with all the characters being crammed together. Pasqually's brick wall features a 'Pasqually's Amateur Hour Live' Logo. The Valence is integrated into the wall and features rainbow lights on the right and left sides, and the Wink is still being placed in the middle. The VHS Player was placed inside Jasper's speaker box, instead of being placed in the control room behind the stage. This variant of the 1-Stage would be installed at six locations in total. Although things such as the 'Pasqually's Amateur Hour Live' logo would be cut after {{< wiki-link "San Diego, CA (3146 Sports Arena Blvd)" >}}. The last location to feature the Mini Unit 1-Stage was {{< wiki-link "Durham, NC (3725 Mayfair St)" >}}, which was removed on October 6, 2024.

### Staten Island Prototype 1-Stage

This design was only installed at the Staten Island, New York location. It featured a large square with a star inside it with a Green, Yellow, Red and Blue behind Chuck E, the rest of the stage would feature buildings from the 2-Stage with them being layered to give depth to the stage, Behind Munch would be a light pink column with half buildings around it on the top portion would feature a CRT TV. Located behind Pasqually, a postcard reading 'Now Appearing' with the Munch's Make Believe Band logo beneath it, the background features Mr. Munch playing piano keys in a hill-like shape. The Wink would be installed on a black valance. Before fall 2012, this stage formerly featured a pull-out stage for live shows. It would be removed due to Hurricane Sandy, which caused severe damage to it. {{< wiki-link "Staten Island, NY (1775-P South Ave)" >}} stage was removed on July 23, 2023.

### 1-Stage

The 1-Stage features a colorful city skyline with red, green, yellow, and blue buildings. Below the buildings are half faux brick walls. Chuck E. and Pasqually in front of faux brick walls with Chuck having a fiber optic 'Chuck E. Cheese' sign with metal pipes that have red and blue fiber optic lights in them. Pasqually sits in front of a blank brick wall. The Wink sits on a black, green, or blue valance. Currently, only two 1-Stages remain. 

### 1-Stage w/ Turntable

The 1-Stage w/ Turntable is identical to the standard 1-Stage, except that Chuck E. stands on a turntable. The turntable has two sides, the Chuck E. side and the black rain curtain side. The Chuck E. side features the Brick Wall, and lighting effects the standard one does, and the black rain curtain side features only a black, red, or blue rain curtain. The turntable would turn around for live shows from 1994 - 2010. The Chuck E. animatronic would then turn into the backroom, and the walkaround would either come out the other side or he would come out of the door next to the stage. The last location to feature the 1-Stage w/ Turntable is {{< wiki-link "Pearl City, HI (850 Kamehameha Hwy Suite 140)" >}}) which removed the Chuck E. animatronic in 2016, permanently having it rotated. The store would close on August 10, 2025.

### 1-Stage w/ 2-Stage Backdrops

The 1-Stage w/ 2-Stage Backdrops is a 1-Stage that instead uses assets of a 2-Stage. The assets used are Chuck E.'s Star, 2-Stage Buildings, 2-Stage planters and grey cover, as well as the Munch's Make Believe Band sign and valances. Due to size, some installations of this stage lacked Pasqually's Amateur Hour backdrop, which was replaced by more buildings. This stage was designed for stores with smaller showrooms or later locations that had the show relocated within the store and formerly had a 2-stage setup. The final location to feature the 1-Stage w/ 2-Stage Backdrops was {{< wiki-link "Santiago (Plaza Oeste), Chile" >}} until it was removed on November 29, 2024.
