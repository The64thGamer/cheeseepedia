***Road Shows*** (also known as ***Chuck E.'s Road Show*** and ***Portable Lives***) was an initiative rolled out nationwide in March of 2000 to allow live shows to be performed outside of the showroom through the use of a boombox, with new CDs released frequently. The last Road Show CD would be released in 2014.

### History
  One of the operational cornerstones of CEC was that every guest would get to see Chuck E. Each store was required to do a live show at 12:00, 1:00, 5:00, 6:00, 7:00, and 8:00. {{< cite 1 >}} Road Shows were created in March 2000 as a way for stores to be able to perform the required live shows during low-volume hours. New Road Show CDs would be released annually and would typically contain the same live shows available in the showroom. However, some live shows would either be shortened or have alternate intros. 

  In the 2010s, the live show schedule would change to every hour. {{< cite 2 >}} In 2012, automatic live shows with countdowns began being tested on the Circles of Light stage. {{< cite 3 >}} Automatic live shows would then be rolled out to all stores with Studio C in January 2013, replacing the need for Road Shows in these stores. {{< cite 4 >}} Existing Stages would receive countdowns but not automatic live shows. Existing Stage stores were still allowed to use Road Shows through the end of 2014, though they were encouraged by the Entertainment Department to do standard live shows in the showroom instead. {{< cite 5 >}}

### Road Show Package
Stores would receive the following items with their initial road show package:
- JVC RV V55-GY Portable Boom Box
- Remote Control
- Carrying Strap
- Audio CD
- 2 Energizer Battery Chargers
- 8 D-Cell Rechargeable Batteries
- 5 AA Alkaline Batteries
