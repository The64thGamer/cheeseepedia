## Actors

- Unknown as Pasqually (Suit)
- Bob West as Pasqually (Voice)

## Instructions

- Mixing & Bunning the Dough
  - Fill the Water Bucket (70*-80* F)
  - Measure the Dough (76*-82* F)
    - If dough is more than 82* F, use colder water (70*-72* F)

Pasqually suggests using ice cubes to cool down the water.
* Melt completely and store it up.

- If dough is less than 76* F, use warmer water
  - Put bucket on the scale
    - 50 lb sack: 23 1/2 lbs water
    - 25 lb sack: 11 3/4 lbs water
    - Scoop out extra water until you get to exactly the right weight.
    - It's easier to take excess water out than to have to add more.

Adding more water requires repeating the water temperature step (70*-80* F) again.

- Pour water into the bowl and add one bag of dough into the water.

## Trivia

- Pasqually's voice interestingly more resembles the voice of Nintendo character 'Mario' more than in any showtape.
