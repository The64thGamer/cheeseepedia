### Silicon Valley Showdown
At the beginning Steve White notes 'Okay, coming up next, Silicon Valley Showdown, subtitled 'Fastest Mouse in the West'. And this the idea is this would be something like a uh . It's a talk sing with a singing chorus' 'The lines during the introduction of Pasqually the Kid,  Wyatt Burp, and Helen Henny were changed. Wyatt's line '...I'm looking for a certain female name of Helen. Met her on email. Thought I'd take her back to my corral' was changed to '...I'm looking for a certain female name of Helen. Met her on email. Thought I'd like to log on for a chat', Pasqually's line '...You can just delete that file cause this is Helen here and she's my gal' was replaced by '...You can just delete that file this data base queen won't date a desert rat' Chuck's line was originally '...They looked at Helen, she sure was pretty, playing a piano programmed with MIDI, the kind of woman no can live without'. in the final mix was replaced with 'They looked at Helen, she sure was pretty, playing a piano programmed with MIDI, smart and sweet, uh that there was no doubt.{{< cite 1 >}}{{< cite 2 >}}
