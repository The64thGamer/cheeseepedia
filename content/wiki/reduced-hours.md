The ***Low Volume Store Initiative*** is a set of plans in April of 2024 applied to underperforming stores to reduce costs, ususally resulting in a closure soon after. It seems some stores may have recieved this earlier, though this is unclear.

## History
Stores would begin recieving instructions from corporate to reduce hours and cut their salad bar some time in early April of 2024. By this time new stores would also not get salad bars upon installation. Only a few stores would recieve salad bar cuts:

- {{< wiki-link "Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}}
- {{< wiki-link "Annapolis, MD (2333-A Forest Dr)" >}} 

Some stores would also begin to close just a year later in 2025.
