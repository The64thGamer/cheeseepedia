The ***Low Volume Store Initiative*** is a set of plans in April of 2024 applied to underperforming stores to reduce costs, ususally resulting in a closure soon after.

## History
Stores would begin recieving instructions from corporate to reduce hours and cut their salad bar some time in early April of 2024. By this time new stores would also not get salad bars upon installation.
