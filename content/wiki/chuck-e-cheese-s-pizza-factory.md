***Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory* is an *[Easy-Bake Oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy-Bake_Oven)* styled pizza maker released in 1999.
The product was made by *[Wham-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham-O)* and stayed in production for an undetermined amount of time. A similar product, Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Maker Play Set, would show up later using *Avenger Chuck*'s design, being made by *EZ-2 Make.***

## Description

The product would come with the oven, which had a storage shelf built into its side, along with two pizza trays, a claw to grab the trays out of the oven, a plastic pizza cutter, and four *Chuck E. Cheese's* tokens. No pizza ingredients were included, requiring the purchase of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory Refills. These refills would be enough to make two pizzas, though also came with 10 free *Chuck E. Cheese's* tickets inside.
The ingredients included were referred to as:

- *Scrumptious Sauce Packets*
- *Super-Duper Dough Packets*
- *Zippy Cheese Packets*
- *Tasty Pepperoni Packet*

## Commercials

Two variations of an ad were put on TV around the time. One starting with 'How much cheese can you put on a Chuck E. Cheese pizza?', and the other with 'Wanna make Chuck E. Cheese pizza?'.
