<h2>History</h2>
In 1997 the Awesome Adventure Machine is considered a failure among ShowBiz and is mostly scrapped as a concept. But one of the concepts from this that survived is the one Animatronic entertainment. ShowBiz consult several different clients to create Animatronics for the new generation  and ultimately landed on Garner Holt Productions. GHP (Garner Holt Productions) created the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Bird (Animatronic)" >}}, and some of the props for the shows.
