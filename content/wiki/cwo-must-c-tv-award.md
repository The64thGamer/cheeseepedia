The **'CWO' (Must C TV Award)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's in 1998.

## Design

This poster, based off of WCW'S NWO (World Championship Wrestling/New World Order.) features Chuck E. Cheese, Mr. Munch, and Helen Henny as wrestlers about to eat an entire pizza on the wrestling ring with Chuck E. holding a pizza cutter and Munch holding a knife & fork while Helen cheers with Pasqually being the referee. The background consist of the crowd cheering on and a mysterious figure in the shadows in the entrance of the door.

## Size/Dimensions

Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.

## Reception

The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
