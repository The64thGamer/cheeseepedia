<b><i>Ventura, CA (4714 Telephone Rd), Store #453</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese that opened on Fall 1983 (month and day currently unknown) as a franchised store with a Balcony Stage, which is still open to this day.
It is located in the Riviera Plaza Shopping Mall across from a few stores like Target.
The opening month is unknown, but it could be around September or October.
<h2>History</h2>
Ventura opened in Fall 1983 and originally had a Balcony Stage and was a franchised-owned store until October 22, 1984, when it was bought by the corporate. Ventura would receive the 1988 remodel in 1989 or 1990 removing the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade, removing PTT decor for CU and other decor, adding the Blue and White awnings over the salad bar which also was updated, the removal of the Cabaret (Lounge) but the King stayed, and checkers outside and inside the store. In the late 90’s, Ventura received the 1993 Remodel which involved the removal of the Chuck E.'s House Facade stage for the 2-Stage, removed CU decor for other decor and Record Posters, and the removal of the King animatronic. In the Late 90's, Ventura received the Phase 3 Remodel which removed older 90's decor, added newer decor, and SkyTubes. Ventura received the 2005 remodel ({{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}) in 2006-2007 which removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, relocating the stage, and removed older decor for newer decor. In November 2018, the store received a repaint after a Starbucks was built right next to it and the side exterior logo was moved closer to the front entrance. In November 2022, the store's exterior signs from all over the building were torn off from strong winds, so the signage had to be replaced with the 2.0 logo and text. Between September 22nd to September 24th, 2023, the store would start its 2.0 remodel, eventually removing the stage by October 1st, which the store is how the store currently sits as of today.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally when Ventura opened, they had a Balcony Stage, as all other Pizza Time Theatres did. Unfortunately, there are not many photos or videos of Ventura back then. They would have it for a few years until the late 80's, when they would receive a C-Stage, they would have it for a short time until 1996-1997 when they would receive a 2-Stage. Ventura would have the 2-Stage for many years until the show’s removal which happened by October 1st, 2023.
