## Trivia

- The Day & Night system created for the show was a result of the CEC Marketing Team. The way the system works is different for the two main types Existing and Studio C. For Existing stages the Day & Night DVDs were separate while for Studio C based systems would automatically switch from Day to Night at 6pm.
- International stores do not use the Promotions of the US shows. So for promotions such as the Menu items, Chupa Chups promotion and Halloween Weekend Promo they don't appear in the show.
- This was the first show to feature Spanish Covid Spots. They're the same as the US ones except now in Spanish and it's done by a girls voice.
