***Programming* is a term used to refer to animating an animatronic character.
The term originated some time during the early years of Creative Engineering, likely as the uniquely digital mechanisms used to control the animatronics for the time were comparable to computer programming. Its use has stuck around in the community and in employees of Chuck E. Cheese corporate to this day.**
