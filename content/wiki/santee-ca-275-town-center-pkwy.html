<b><i>Santee, CA (275 Town Center Pkwy), Store #207</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened on September 18th, 2023 with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}.
This store opened as the fourth 2.0 in the San Diego area (Oceanside is also a suburb of San Diego, which received 2.0 in 2021), and is the newest CEC to open in California since Los Angeles (2706 Wilshire Blvd) opened in April 2014 ({{< wiki-link "Fairfield, CA (1027 Oliver Rd)" >}} reopened as CEC in July 2022, so they are not new to CEC).
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Pre-CEC 1995-2023</h3>
Before development on the store started, the space was a Hometown Buffet which presumably closed in 2017. The Hometown Buffet received generally poor reviews online, with the restaurant sitting at 3.0 stars. The store would stay vacant for several years after closing, with a Google Street View from January 2022 still showing the Hometown Buffet sign still on the building.
<h3>CEC 2023-Present </h3>
In January 2023, a bid appeared on Parkway Construction's (the company that does the 2.0 Remodels) website for the store, which around the same month, an article from SanDiegoVille.com titled 'First New Age Chuck E. Cheese Location Set to Open in San Diego' would release, discussing about the store and mentioning that the store would open as early as Summer 2023.<sup>(1)</sup>
By June 2023, the store would begin its conversion process to a Chuck E. Cheese.
On September 18th, 2023, the store had its soft opening. The store had its Grand Opening on October 12th, 2023.
