The ***Dolli Dimples Show Selector* (no official name given) is a prototype selection unit for the {{< wiki-link "Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic)" >}}.**

## History

Shortly after {{< wiki-link "Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic)" >}} was installed at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}, Pizza Time Theatre prototyped for an alteration to Dolli's show playback to have a jukebox unit that could have coins inserted into it to play specific shows. The single prototype box would be moved throughout the early corporate offices before eventually being thrown in a scrap pile at the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}}. Dale Benjamin would recover the box and keep it with them till present day.<sup>(1)</sup>
