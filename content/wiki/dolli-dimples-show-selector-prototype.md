The ***Pizza Time Theatre Show Selector*** is a prototype selection unit known to be at the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} and possibly at other early stores, most likely with {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}. The units would be set up with Cabaret or Lounge acts and were coin operated.

## History

Shortly after {{< wiki-link "Kooser Dolli Dimples (Animatronic)" >}} was installed at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}}, Pizza Time Theatre prototyped for an alteration to Dolli's show playback to have a jukebox unit that could have coins inserted into it to play specific shows. {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}} possibly had one installed with their {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny (Lounge)" >}} either at or near opening, as it is noted both stores had their acts be coin-operated. PTT would perform a survey for their coin boxes of their various locations, and noticed both acts had a 1:2 quarter to token ratio, unlike the usual arcades which had a 1:6 ratio. PTT believed this showed adults were activating the shows more than kids.

The Kooser prototype box would be moved throughout the early corporate offices before eventually being thrown in a scrap pile at the {{< wiki-link "Sunnyvale, CA (1213 Innsbruck Drive)" >}}. Dale Benjamin would recover the box and keep it with them to present day.{{< cite 1 >}}
