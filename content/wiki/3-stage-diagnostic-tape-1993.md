***3-Stage Diagnostics Tape 1993* was a diagnostics tape released just two years after the initial Concept Unification Diagnostics Tape 1, as the original was no longer usable during the 1993 showtape conversion of signals.
Multiple things from the *ShowBiz Pizza Time* corporate office show can be seen changed between each tape. Chuck and Helen's masks are different, Munch's organ cover was changed from the early sunrise design to the standard design, Jasper's guitar was changed from the original Beach Bear guitar to the cheese guitar, and Pasqually's drum front changing from the orange swirl design to the blue explosion design.
The {{< wiki-link "CU Flower (Animatronic)" >}} also makes an appearance in the tape, being shown on Pasqually's stage.**

## Trivia:

- This showtape was released as a result of a brand new Eprom being released. This rendered any show prior to July 1993, including CU Diagnostics Tape 1, impossible to play.
- Despite being used by this point Live Floods don't appear in this tape.
- The Gobo Spot doesn't appear in this as it wasn't a thing until September 1994 as before that it was Munch, Jr. Spot.
- At the end of the showtape a character named 'Flower' appears. It wasn't installed on corps 3-Stage until sometime after the March 1991 Diagnostics. It was seemingly programmed as early as July 1993 and as late as January 1995. The signal used is Dook's right ear. It's currently unknown if ever installed in store.
- This was Lost Media until June 6th 2022. When it was uploaded by YouTube user 'Chase Taylor'.
