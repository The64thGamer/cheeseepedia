<h2>History</h2>
Springfield opened its doors on April 22nd, 1982, as the 4th ShowBiz Pizza Place in Illinois (4th after {{< wiki-link "Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Bloomingdale, IL (132 E Lake St)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Arlington Heights, IL (955 W Dundee Rd)" >}}). It was originally and currently a corporate-owned store. Like many other ShowBiz locations, it had a typical ShowBiz layout. Although some little documentation exists back in the ShowBiz days, it can be determined that Springfield was one of several locations to receive an Uncle Klunk show package (and a Santa Claus retrofit package). Like many ShowBiz locations in the late 1980s, Springfield received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade and the 80s remodel.
In 1991, Springfield received Concept Unification. This converted the show to Munch's Make Believe Band. In around the Mid-Late 90s, Springfield would receive {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} which removed some early 90s decor, added new decor, and added SkyTubes. Springfield remained this way until Early 2011, when they received the 2005 remodel and the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}}. This also included tearing down the Showroom walls & balcony seating, removing 90s decor, expanding the store, adding bright florescent lighting, & adding purple walls.
On June 11th, 2024, the store would begin its Legacy Store variant of the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}. On June 14th, 2024, Springfield would receive parts from {{< wiki-link "Whitehall, PA (1000 Lehigh Valley Mall)" >}}'s CU-1 Stage and {{< wiki-link "Laurel, MD (936 Fairlawn Ave)" >}}'s 3-Stage from the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS)" >}}. Once the parts arrived, mechanical repairs began taking place on the show. The purple walls would be repainted to white and the Gameroom TVs were installed in the store. The store would also keep the majority of its 2005 remodel art.
On July 3rd, 2024, CEC announced that the Grand Reopening would take place on the 25th.
