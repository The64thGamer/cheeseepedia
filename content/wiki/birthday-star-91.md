**Birthday Star '91** was a scrapped birthday show that was initially created for {{< wiki-link "CEC American Pride" >}}.

## Release

Originally intended to be released to stores alongside {{< wiki-link "CEC American Pride" >}}, this would have been the first edition of Birthday Star. 
Like all birthday shows that came before it, Birthday Star was not produced to be a live show. All of the animatronic characters, including Chuck E. Cheese, were programmed to perform the song at birthday parties at the press of a button. 
As was standard practice since the brand's inception, however, the Chuck E. Cheese walk-around character was present in the showroom and stores found that the show lent itself well to live performances on account of it being a straightforward three-minute song with no character dialogue or skits.
The show would be modified and release in 1992 as {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '92" >}}.

## Summary

Birthday Star '91 is an upbeat and eclectic big band/swing number. The show opens with the band shouting 'Happy birthday' as they play their instruments. 
Chuck E. Cheese comes out and encourages the audience to get on their feet and clap their hands. Pasqually interjects, 'It's time for cake!', with Mr. Munch following with, 'And it's time to celebrate a birthday Chuck E. Cheese style!'
Chuck E. Cheese style!' From there, Chuck E. leads the audience in the first of an iconic call-and-response that would be it's then followed by: 'I say happy, you say birthday! Happy! (birthday) Happy! (birthday) Now clap your hands 
(clap, clap, clap) and stomp your feet! (Stomp stomp stomp) The band proceeds to sing the song's chorus, followed by a repeat of the Happy Birthday chant. 
Helen and Jasper share a harmonized duet as they sing the bridge as Chuck E. leads into a reprise of the Happy Birthday chant. Once sung, the band shouts, 'Get ready to blow out your candles!'
The music builds to a climax as the candles are lit, and the birthday stars blow them out to thunderous applause from the band and the rest of the party, as the music decrescendos. 
The band performs a reprise of the chorus, joined now by the Chuck E. Kids, followed by another, this time in a higher key. One last time, Chuck E leads the showroom in the Happy Birthday chant. The number ends with Chuck E. shouting 
'We hope everybody in your party has a great time! And we all want to salute our birthday star!' and joins the band and the Chuck E. Kids singing 'Happy birthday!' With a few trumpet blasts, the song comes to an end.
