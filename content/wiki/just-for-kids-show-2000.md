## Production

- The Lakewood Theater in Dallas, TX is featured in 'Are you eating?'.
- There was a special shirt made with the show's logo for the production crew.

## Trivia:

- The Studio C Puppets for this show feature white borders around each square for the Studio C Puppets. Helen's is green, Pasqually's is red, Munch is amber, and Jasper is blue.
- This was the final show to feature the Studio C Bluescreen footage. It also seemingly has the Studio C Bluescreen footage leftover from {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Variety Show - Best of 1999" >}}.
- This was Karisa McKinney's final show as Helen Henny.
