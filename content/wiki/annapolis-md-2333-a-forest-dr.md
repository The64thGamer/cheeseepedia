***2333-A Forest Dr, Store #50*** was a Chuck E. Cheese in Annapolis, Maryland in the Festival at Riva Shopping Center that opened on April 10th, 1993 and closed on September 1, 2025.

## History

Annapolis opened on April 10th, 1993 at the Festival at Riva Shopping Center with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. The store would receive its first remodel around the Mid-Late 1990's which included the removal of the Ball Crawl for the SkyTubes and the changing of the exterior logo (The letters were surprisingly white instead of Red and Yellow). Annapolis would remain this way until Summer of 2011 when they would receive the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing the Showroom walls, Balcony Seating, redoing the Ordering Counter, Salad Bar, reconfiguring the Kid Check area, and remodeling the exterior (As well as changing the color of the letters from white to red). March 5th 2016 Annapolis started to revamp their exterior ( But they kept the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} sign) and then replaced their Emergency Exit Doors in the showroom. During this process the Skytubes were removed. In 2016, 2017 or 2019 a water leak would occur above the Helen animatronic, causing its mask to collect mold and water damage. In August 2024, the Helen animatronic's mask caught severe mold on it, and prompted negative reactions from fans online, more specifically from a Reddit post on r/chuckecheese. The mask would later be cleaned off, but the leaky roof seems to have remained. Annapolis would keep their 2-Stage and 2010 Update until they closed on September 1, 2025 after 32 years of operation due to their lease agreement expiring and low sales. The bots would be sent to the SPT Distribution Center along with some of the props, but a few of their posters would be destroyed.

## Stages

When Annapolis first opened, they received a 2-Stage. This was one of the few 2-Stages that didn't have Pasqually's Brick Wall onstage. By 2000, the side to side curtains were replaced with Up and Down curtains. This was one of the few stores that opened after 2006 not to ever have the Cool Chuck outfit. By 2008, the Tuxedo &amp; Derby was replaced with the Avenger outfit. In the Early-Mid 2010's, Pasqually's drumhead was changed from the Orange Swirl from when they opened to the Explosion Drumhead that they keep until their closure. In September 2013, Chuck's Avenger Cap was removed. Sometime in 2016, 2017 or 2019 a ceiling tile caused leaking, damaging Helen's mask. In August 2024, the Helen animatronic's mask caught severe mold on it, and prompted negative reactions from fans online. The mask would later be cleaned off, but the leaky roof seems to have remained. Annapolis would keep their 2-Stage until they closed on September 1, 2025 with their bots being sent to the SPT Distribution Center.
