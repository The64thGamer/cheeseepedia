The **Showroom Sign (SPP Signage) ** was a signage found at Showbiz Pizza locations.

This sign would feature at all showbiz pizza locations in until the 1990's remodel, where the Chuck E. Cheese Showroom Signage would replace it.

## Design

The Showroom sign was a hanging sign near the entrance to the showroom, featuring the ShowBiz Pizza logo and 'Showroom' on it.
