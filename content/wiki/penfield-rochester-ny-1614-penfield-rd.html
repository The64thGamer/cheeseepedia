<h2> History </h2>
Penfield opened on March 17, 1982, as Pizza Time Theatre with a Balcony Stage It first had the 1981 remodel, which included Cabaret rooms, the Fantasy Forest, and of course the stage itself. it had a cheese crawl stage at some point, probably after the first PTT remodel. In 1989, the store received the 1988 remodel, which involved uniting some of the rooms and all the counters, replacing all the PTT decor with new decor, and removing the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. However, they kept the PTT Signage. They remained like this until September 16, 1996, when they would close possibly due to a disagreement. As of July 2023, the store is now Advance Auto Parts & United States Postal Service.
