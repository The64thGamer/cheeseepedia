In the mid 1990's, Waterbury remodeled to the <a href="{{< ref "wiki/SPT 1992 Remodel Program" >}}">SPT 1992 Remodel</a>, which involved removing the checkers around the store, the blue and white awnings, and the neon signage. In the Summer of 2001, Munch's cap was removed. By 2004, they added some of the 1999 décor and in December; they replaced the side to side curtains with the up and down curtains.
