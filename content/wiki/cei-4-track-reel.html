<h2> Baking </h2>
CEI reels come from Ampex, and are notorious for having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky-shed_syndrome"> Sticky-Shed Syndrome</a>. This requires them to have their moisture absorbed before playback- otherwise the tape will be damaged. Attempting to play an unbaked reel will produce an audible squeaking sound.
Baking a tape can either be done in a convection oven or a dehydrator. The temperature should be between 130 °F to 140 °F. Reels should bake for at least 4 hours, but will have better results when done longer. Some users bake for up to 24 hours. Multiple tapes can be baked without changing bake time.
Tapes should be left out for a while before playing them. At minimum this should be 8 hours but most users wait an entire day. Depending on the moisture of the tape's storage, the tape will last a few weeks to a few months before being needed to be baked again.<sup>(1)</sup><sup>(2)</sup>
