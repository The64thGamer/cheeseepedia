**3-Stage Diagnostics** was a rerelease of {{< wiki-link "3-Stage 2002 Diagnostics" >}} on DVD. The diagnostics were initially included with all 3-Stage DVDs, but became their own disc in January 2007. This disc would be rereleased many times with multiple different covers (including a rockstar release in 2014) until 2023 when all 3-Stage stores converted from DVD to Navori, which had diagnostics uploaded digitally.

## Diagnostics List:

Movements are repeated five times while lights and curtains are only done once. This is in order of how the movements are shown in the Diagnostics tape, not in order of the bits.
