***Tim's World Rules*** was custom software at Chuck E. Cheese corporate developed in 1992 to restrict access to Cyberstar units by employees.

## Description
When an employee accessed a restricted function on their Cyberstar unit, the system would give the employee a random 5 character string. They would call CEC Corporate and give them the string. The corp employee would input the string in (after verification and reasoning for the change likely), and have the formula convert it to another random string. This would be told back to the store employee, who could input it into their machine and gain access.
