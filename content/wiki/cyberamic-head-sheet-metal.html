Same as most grade 8 yellow zinc plated bolts lol. I'm like 99% sure, they wouldn't need to plate stainless and it's makes no sense to use anything but normal carbon steel. Everything else would be way overkill. It's cheaper to not plate or not use a dyed plating. But obviously plating is better than none for rust prevention. But yes they probably went to a lower grade plating over time. That's why they aren't yellow. Maybe normal zinc plating or nickel plating\"", "Cyberamics from Kooser sold on Ebay in 2021 show yellow-zinc plating.", "https://www.ebay.com/itm/396317900634", "Correspondance from Cyberamics repro manufacturer @MrCrayfish"]

The <b><i>Cyberamic Sheet Metal Head</i></b>, Part #000-0044-__, is an A36 carbon steel frame that holds Cyberamic heads together, alongside mounting any facial or neck movements.<sup>(4)</sup>
<h2>Variants</h2>
Three variants of the head fully assembled were present in order lists.
<ul>
    <li>Part #000-0044-10 was the standard head for Chuck, Guest/Helen, Munch, and Jasper.</li>
    <li>Part #000-0044-20 was for Pasqually.</li>
    <li>Part #000-0044-30 was for Artie and Dollie.</li>
</ul>
Multiple variants exist across the years the head was made. Each made small changes from the previous design.
<h3>Pizza Time Theatre Produced</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1980 - No top bend, thin steel (unconfirmed thickness), different mounting holes.<sup>(7)</sup></li>
    <li>Early 1981 - No top bend, thin steel (3.0226mm)<sup>(6)</sup></li>
    <li>Late 1981 - No top bend, thicker steel (3.175mm)<sup>(6)</sup></li>
    <li>Early 1982 - Top bend facing forward</li>
    <li>Early 1983 - Potentially a different yellow zinc coating that was more resilient to deterioration over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kinetix Produced</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Around 1991 - Refurbished PTT frames which used a different mouth mount, different eye turn mechanism, and were re-tubed.</li>
    <li>1991 - Eyelid cylinder slot rounded out, different mouth mount. Removed two holes on the bottom right used for pilot valves.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Animation World Produced</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Around 1994 - Top bend facing backward, back to using the original mouth mount.</li>
    <li>Last Batches - Black colored metal.</li>
</ul>
All Cyberamics used yellow zinc plating, though potentially the intensity of the plating varied in certain batches. Some Cyberamics are almost gold in color, but certain bots, whether through natural aging or less plating used, appear closer to gray.<sup>(4)(5)</sup>
<br>
Certain bots with the usual two holes below the eye cavity have an extra one between them. This appears mostly on the right eye, once confirmed on the left eye, and once confirmed on both. The assembly usually inserted in the two holes would sometimes be inserted in this middle hole, likely meaning it was a modification made in-store when the bottom hole occurred too much stress and wear.
<h2>Measurements</h2>
As a full set of confirmed measurements is not available, multiple partial lists are available to varying accuracy.
<br><br>
Cyberamic parts were designed with some measurements at 1/8th inch accuracy, and some at 1/16th inch accuracy. Due to the tools of the time not being as accurate as modern machining, raw measurements will all vary in tolerance, so should be fit to the nearest 1/16th of an inch. Additionally, most hole measurements were specced to measure from edge-to-edge rather than center-edge<sup>(7)</sup>
