***Magic Stage Christmas Tape* was a unique showtape created for the {{< wiki-link "Magic Stage Prototype" >}} in November of 1985.
The show and stage would debut at an unknown Texas store. The characters were rebranded from the Rock-afire Explosion to a band simply called 'Magic'. Character names and Rock-afire shows were still used for the showtape however. An uncredited announcer is used exclusively for the tape to introduce the band.
{{< wiki-link "Sun (Animatronic)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Moon (Animatronic)" >}}, and Antioch (Animatronic)|Antioch would be absent from the show due to them being taken off stage, though most likely their show signals were still being sent due to the re-use of older programming, as seen in other similar instances to removed characters.<sup>(1)</sup>**

## Audio

The tape's audio was found on a cassette from an undisclosed source and released to the public in 2023.<sup>(2)</sup> The given audio has no breaks between show segments, despite the *Pre-Show Skit* referencing a 2 minute gap until the *Show Announcement* segment. It is unclear if the breaks were removed to fit the audio onto the cassette, or if the showtape also did not have these breaks between segments.
The original reel audio alongside {{< wiki-link "Data" >}} for the shows are still lost media.

## Summary

The tape starts with an announcer reminding Billy Bob that the show is starting in 2 minutes. At the start of the show the announcer introduces the band 'Magic', a collaboration between ShowBiz Pizza Place and 'Good Times Everywhere'. The rest of the tape consists of Christmas segments used in previous year's showtapes.
