***SPP Rolfe & Earl*** was a special showtape used during {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} to entertain guests while the *Rock-afire Explosion* was converted over to *Munch's Make Believe Band*.
The tape stars the Rolfe and Earl voice actors from ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., (Speculated to have been Joe Conti as Rolfe) returning from their roles in 1986. They comment about the stage being under construction, with Rolfe providing Earl hints throughout the tape to figure out that Chuck E. Cheese is behind the changes.**

## Concept Unification

The tape came with the entire Concept Unification package, which included a special backup SPP Rolfe & Earl Emergency Backup Tape, the first 3-Stage showtape {{< wiki-link "SPP Concept Unification Premiere" >}}, and its own backup tape being {{< wiki-link "SPP Concept Unification Emergency Backup Tape" >}}, along with other material.
During the Concept Unification conversion process, the Rolfe & Earl stage would be kept up while the store was open, so the character could perform alongside this tape. A special Rolfe & Earl birthday was included for any potential birthday parties while the other stages was still under construction. The Rolfe & Earl stage would then be dismantled and turn into Chuck E.'s stage overnight, allowing Concept Unification Premiere to be ready the next morning.
This makes it one of the few showtapes in ShowBiz Pizza Time's lifetime that only lasted a few days. Because of the haphazard timing of Concept Unification across stores however, it could be seen from its initial release on July 20, 1990, to sometime in 1992, making it also one of the longest lasting showtapes shown.

## Trivia

- This is the only Cyberstar showtape that features a birthday in just the first intermission. This may have been part of a plan to reduce birthdays while the conversion was happening, as the guest experience only having one animatronic present was not as high.
- The latest showtape referenced in the clips was {{< wiki-link "SPP Faith / Dreams / Kids" >}}, being from August 31, 1989. No 1990 clips were featured, leaving Neighbors 1, Neighbors 2, Moms, and TV Themes out.
- The intermission music & videos are the same from {{< wiki-link "SPP Faith / Dreams / Kids" >}}, however in Intermission 1 Gigi On The Beach 'Please Please Me' was left out in favor for the birthday skit.
- As this is the final Rock-afire Explosion show for ShowBiz Pizza locations, this is also the final show to use ShowBiz's voice actors for the characters. Despite this, the majority of the show consists of reused segments from other showtapes, so for the most part the original voice actors can still be heard during this show.
