This is only by confirmation that they had the {{< wiki-link "Country Klunk (Event)" >}} event, which is presumed to always have coincided with storesCountry Klunk tape filmed there.

Two other stores are inferred to have had this event due to showing Country Klunk, though it is unknown if Kedzie received a traveling Klunk, or obtained one from Farmington Hills, MI (29955 Orchard Lake Rd) with all the other animatronics they obtained from their closure.

### Unconfirmed Stores

Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q
