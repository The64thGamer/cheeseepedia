The <b>Sun Animatronic</b> (Also the Building Animatronic) is a figure created by Creative Engineering Inc. for Showbiz Pizza Place locations from 1980-1983. It is a very simple figure, as its only movements are raising from behind the backdrop and opening its mouth. During {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, Sun was retrofitted into Building.
<h2> Movements </h2>
The Sun features 2 movements, being its head raise, and mouth. The raise mechanism has a spring within the pole attaching the Sun to the raise block, this allows for a bouncing effect.

It is notable that early Sun mechanisms used to have a body turn, however this was never programmed, and after the initial production batch the body turn was removed. This movement is mentioned on early movement lists and is installed on David Ferguson's Sun animatronic.
