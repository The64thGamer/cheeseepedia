***Cupertino, CA (10060 Bubb Rd.)*** was the Pizza Time Theatre main offices from February of 1979 to May of 1980.

## History
The previous tenant to the Cupertino building was 'Syntex'. The move would happen between late Janury to February of 1979. Gene Landrum would note "Not only are we expanding our staff, but we're also adding a manufacturing facility, and we wanted our corporate head-quarters, franchise development offices and manufacturing to be under the same roof."{{< cite 4 >}}

During the early months of 1980, the PBS TV show "Ben Wattenberg's 1980" would shoot footage at the offices for its June 16th episode, which is currently not found.{{< cite 7 >}}{{< cite 8 >}}{{< cite 9 >}}

The offices would shortly be moved out almost a year later to the {{< wiki-link "Sunnyvale, CA (1213 Innsbruck Drive)" >}} offices, planned for April of 1980 but eventually completed in May of 1980.{{< cite 6 >}} The Pizza Times noted that "Moving Day was really Moving Week from the time the first boxes were packed until the last carton was emptied." {{< cite 5 >}}
