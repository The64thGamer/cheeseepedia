***Munch Mouth* is an arcade machine used in {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}}.**

## Gameplay

The gameplay is unknown, but from the photo we have it seems like you would shoot balls into munch's teeth knocking them down one by one. there was also likely a score to like other games of this type and a timer that would count down to 0.
