## Trivia:

- The intermission music is the same as SPP Best of 3 (except for the last two intermissions)
- This showtape introduced a brand new Chuck E. Cheese puppet while the rest of the cast's puppets got reworked to be more polished.
- Included at the end of the tape are two videos that would be skipped during regular playback. The first is a behind-the-scenes video of the production of the show, including footage of the voice actors, kid auditions, and the Dallas Symphony recording the CEC TV Classic ID music. The second is the Concept Unification Demo.
