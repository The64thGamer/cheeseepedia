During the remodel the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}} would be replaced with Version Three of the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}. With it still being a franchise certain aspects would be retained from its {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}} such as the wood paneling seen by the bathrooms & the wood paneling near Kid Check.
