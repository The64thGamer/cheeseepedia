The Boo Boo Animatronic was a retrofited {{< wiki-link "Looney Bird (Animatronic)" >}}

## History
On March 4, 1987 ShowBiz Pizza Time, INC would obtain a quote from Creative Presentation, INC for how much Boo Boo would cost. The cost would be $5,000 for a single, or $1,500 for multiple orders of 5 or more.{{< cite 1 >}} By April 2, 1987 an agreement was formed between ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc and Creative Presentations, Inc regarding what would be designed and fabricated. Three sets of conversion kits to transform Looney Bird into Boo Boo would be created. The conversion kit for Boo Boo would include ''A new Boo Boo cosmetic head, including a new jaw plate to conform Boo Boo's head configurations.  All other movements existing in looney bird's head will be maintained except eye blink'. 'A fur body suit to fit over the shoulders and upper body of the mechanism'. 'A Boo Boo costume, i.e. bow tie'.The date planned for completion of the first set was May 14, 1987. For the remaining set of cosmetics were to be completed by June 15, 1987 'and delivered to locations designated by ShowBiz by June 31, 1987'.{{< cite 2 >}}. On July 8, 1987 The final design of Boo Boo's cosmetics would be approved by The Taft Merchandising Group, Inc. {{< cite 5 >}} The first location to debute with Boo Boo was Omaha, NE in September 1987{{< cite 4 >}} during installation the packing list, instruction manual were not included, and 'Boo-Boos top-knot was not sewn to his head', later that month Colorado Springs, CO would begin installation also missing the packing list, 'No iries for either Yogi or Boo-Boo. When they arrived the next day, Boo-Boo's iries were lacking the threaded metal portion by which they are attached'. 'The top knot once again was not sewn on, and did not come with any pins'. 'The instructions were still incomplete, but included an unsigned apology'{{< cite 3 >}}. On October 1, 1987 an installation memo would be sent to Paul Linden & Stan Black from Jul Kamen addressing the installation issues faced at both stores and 'unnecessary delays due to the lack of required cosmetic and mechanical parts which were not furnished by the manufacturer, C.P.I.' 'before Thanksgiving' in 1987 Boo Boo would be removed with {{< wiki-link "Looney Bird (Animatronic)" >}} re-installed. While plans existed for a return in January 1988 those plans would never come to light. {{< cite 3 >}}
