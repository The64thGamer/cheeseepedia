## Trivia:

- The intermission music in this show comes from an album called *Contempory Christmas* by Ron Roy.
- Santa's voice actor, Ron Schneider, previously voiced Mr Mouth.
- 'Run Run Rudolph' is sung by Munch, but was programmed to Jasper. This song was also used as a live show, which also includes the error.
