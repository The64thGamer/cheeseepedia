The articulated Munch walkaround head was created in 1996 by former CEI employee, David "Billy Bob" Irvin. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:

- August 1996
- April 1997
- August 1997

During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with his standard 90's outfit. However, during an intermission in the August 1997 show, he is seen without clothes other than his green "Lead of the Band" tie and a black jacket.
In preparation for the Galaxy 5000 movie, the articulated head was refurbished by Billy Bob. In the process, the head was seen paired with the standard outfit and the hat was changed into a yellow color, likely to avoid interfering with the heavy usage of green-screening during production.
As of 2024, it is unknown of where the head or any other accompanying parts could be.
