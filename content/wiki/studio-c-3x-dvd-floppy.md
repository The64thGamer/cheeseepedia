The ***Studio C 3x DVD + Floppy* was a showtape format used for Studio C. This format replaced the Studio C 4x Laserdisc + Files|Studio C 4x Laserdisc + Files format with the release of the August 1999 showtape.
The Floppy is a 3.5 inch Floppy Disk containing a showtape upgrade for the Studio C Control System. This Floppy Disk would install new showtape files onto the system.
Most of the time all 3 DVDs would contain the same content, the Studio C Control System uses the 3 DVDs to have 3 sources of video and audio to pull from.**
