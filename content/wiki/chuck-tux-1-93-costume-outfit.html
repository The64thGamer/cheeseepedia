1993 updated the walkaround tux making it slimmer and more like a standard tuxedo. This time the whole tuxedo is just black polyester all throughout, the lapels are black, and cummerbund is a smaller version of the 92 V 2 Tux's cummerbund. From 1993-2001 tuxedo vest and pants are manufactured by First Nighter Formal Wear.
