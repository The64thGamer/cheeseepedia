The ***Prop TV* was a {{< wiki-link "Artifact Shelves" >}} item that was created for Chuck E. Cheese's locations in 1994.**

## Design

The TV's design would vary by location and its picture for the theme of the shelf, with the most common design variant having a dark brown color with fabric-like speakers and curved edges on both sides of the screen. The screen would be set to fit in with whatever theme the TV was at.
