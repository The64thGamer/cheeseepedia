<h2>Design</h2>
The plush has a cylindrical body with two cylindrical legs. Its arms are curved with its right being in a waving position. His hands have a set of four detailed fingers. The construction of his head is very complex, using multiple different colored furs in many places. His snout is white with a big plastic nose and has eight orange freckles. His face has a creamy white color and surrounds his eyes, snout and mouth. It uses two embroidered lines to represent a smile and has a separate red felt piece attached to the edge of his mouth and snout to represent his tongue. The rest of his head is soft brown fur. His ears use black fur connected to a brown piece of felt. Depending on how well stitched they are, they can be floppy. His eyes are plastic pieces using black for the pupil and orange for his eyelids.
His hat uses a weird papery material with a red ribbon. He has a red bandana that can be untied and taken off. He's wearing a cow print shirt under his overalls, those overalls feature plastic buttons and a pocket. His shoes are red with white detailing and shoelaces.
