In the Summer of 2001, Munch's cap was removed. By 2004, they added some of the 1999 d√©cor and in December; they replaced the side to side curtains with the up and down curtains. In April 2005, the Helicopter Light was replaced with the Gemini. Curtains were disabled in July 2005. Helen's cosmetics were replaced in April 2006.
