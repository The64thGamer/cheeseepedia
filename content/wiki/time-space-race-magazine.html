The <b>TIME Space Race (Magazine)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.
<h2> Design </h2>
The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Astronaut (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese in a Astronaut outfit with him holding his helmet on his right hand. This poster is a parody of the space race magazines, which were a big event during the time period when these posters were being made.
