The For a free show... push this button and watch me go! was a sign created for *Pizza Time Theatre* locations in the 1980s.

## Production

This unique sign was used in the cabaret and lounge areas at Pizza Time Theatre locations.
This sign allegedly replaced the '1 Token Starts Our Show' (PTT Signage)|'1 Token Starts Our Show' sign and system, although would still retain the same concept in showing guests they could start the show on command.<sup>(1)</sup>

## Design

This sign is a yellow, black, and white beveled rectangle that appears to be encased within the plastic. At the four corners of the sign, holes where the sign could be screwed into a wall can be seen; alongside of a larger hole in the center of the sign that'd be able to start the cabaret or lounge act.
