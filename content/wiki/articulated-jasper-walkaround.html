The articulated Jasper walkaround head was created in 1996 by former CEI employee, David “Billy Bob” Irvin. This head was used in three different showtapes, those being:<ul><li>August 1996</li><li>April 1997</li><li>August 1997</li></ul>
During these showtapes, the head was often seen paired with Jasper’s standard 90’s outfit.
For preparation of the Galaxy 5000 movie, the articulated head was refurbished by Billy Bob. Notably, this was the only one that didn't see any alterations during the production of the movie.
As of 2024, it is unknown of where the head or any other accompanying parts could be.
