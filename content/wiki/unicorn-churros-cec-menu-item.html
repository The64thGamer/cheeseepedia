The <b><i>Unicorn Churros</i></b> are a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's" >}} menu item that were introduced on April 8th, 2019.<sup>(1)</sup><sup>(2)</sup><sup>(3)</sup>

The item currently consists of five churros dusted with three different flavors of sugar: cotton candy (pink), sour apple (green), and blue raspberry. Their packaging fittingly bears the likeness of {{< wiki-link "Ronnie the Unicorn" >}}.

<h2>History</h2>
The Unicorn Churros were first announced on March 28th, 2019, ahead of their debut on April 8th. This was one day ahead of National Unicorn Day on April 9th - on that day, customers who bought 30 minutes of "all you can play" time would receive an order of churros for free.<sup>(2)</sup> In addition, the company launched a social media campaign to promote the new item, offering prizes to people who posted pictures of themselves with their hair in a unicorn horn (alongside the hashtag "#UnicornItChallenge").<sup>(3)</sup> Comments from Chuck E. Cheese's officials (including then-CEO Tom Leverton) indicated that the item was in part meant to cash in on the popularity of unicorns at the time.<sup>(4)</sup><sup>(5)</sup>

While the churros were originally only available for a limited time (specifically until June 6th),<sup>(2)</sup><sup>(3)</sup> they instead became a permanent item. Later communication from the company often treated them as a seasonal item, sometimes grouping them with the {{< wiki-link "Rainbow Lollipops (CEC Menu Item)" "Rainbow Lollipops" >}}, the {{< wiki-link "Unicorn Cupcake (CEC Menu Item)" "Unicorn Cupcake" >}}, the {{< wiki-link "Unicorn Cotton Candy (CEC Menu Item)" "Unicorn Cotton Candy" >}}, and/or the {{< wiki-link "Rainbow Ice Dippin' Dots (CEC Menu Item)" "Rainbow Ice Dippin' Dots" >}} (all of which were only offered in the spring).<sup>(6)</sup><sup>(7)</sup><sup>(8)</sup> However, Wayback Machine archives of Chuck E. Cheese's menu show that the churros consistently remained on the menu year-round.

In April 2020, the Unicorn Churros were offered for $3 as part of a special "$5 or less" carry-out menu.<sup>(9)</sup><sup>(10)</sup> This would end between June 20th<sup>(11)</sup> and the 25th.<sup>(12)</sup>

The item would receive two significant changes no later than June 10, 2021: it would come with five churros instead of four, and its price would increase from $3.99 to $4.99.<sup>(13)</sup>
