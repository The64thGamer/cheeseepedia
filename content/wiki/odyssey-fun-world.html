Odyssey Fun World is a FEC opened in Tinley Park Illinois, and Naperville Illinois sometime between 1998-2000.

Both restaurants housed the "obscure" New-Rock-afire Explosion, and is known for maintaining the show to live the longest for it's history.

Tinley Park's restaurant opened in 1994 with a New-Rock-afire Explosion already made for them. In 1997, Tinley would salvage Magic City's NRAE, the center stage animatronics as Magic City used a karaoke set for the NRAE. Tinley's show in the 2000s was fine and had working turntables, soon, the turntables would start to rotate even after the show ended. This caused a problem, in 2009, the OFW technicians decided to try and find out which controlled the Turntables, this was a failure and so they shut off the air exhaust and let the Dance-atronics stay in their original positions. 
Tinley Park also wanted to "digitize" the NRAE, they asked Aaron for help by digitizing some Showtapes and using a Windows computer instead of a Apple II computer to run the show and Tivo. This ultimately lead to the robots not looking programmed currently, not in sync with movements, and breaking down eventually in 2011 that lead to their "Out-Of-Order" state until they were sold in 2019. Aaron didn't even know what was the issue, and unfortunately couldn't assist the OFW team with help.

Naperville's restaurant opened sometime in 1998-2000s with weird features like a not colored stage, (the bottom) and a Toyland outfit for Mitzi. For some odd reason, the show's turntables would rip out the character hoses, so they shut down the turntables. Naperville used the original Apple II programming until the show went out of order. In Naperville, the show would have more content on social media than the Tinley show in the 2000s and mid 2010s, as the show would change in condition or stay the same, from the lights breaking, to certain elbow movements not working. 

In the late 2010s, these shows would be sold to the "Rock-afire Mafia" for both shows and each robot. Jacob Goldberg would earn the Tivo Shows and some Tinley bots, he is the only person as of 2025 to show his Tivo and NRAE bots recently. There was some controversy with David Ferguson, a member of the Mafia, and Connor Leschinky. David was holding a Beach Bear background for Connor, as he couldn't fit in his car. David then sold it away, which wasn't part of the plan.
