**Chuck E.'s Parade** is a scrapped live show intended to be paired with {{< wiki-link "SPP Concept Unification Premiere" >}} .
Chuck E.'s Parade did not get far in development with only the audio being created and finalized. {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's Live 90" >}} would be used instead.

## Summary
Mr. Munch begins by telling the audience that Chuck E. Cheese will be preforming soon! Jasper then makes a joke about why they don't get down and perform with the kids in which Helen says its easier to see up there. Pasqually then reminds the audience that Chuck E. Cheese will be out very soon. They then sing a parody of ['Pure Imagination' (From 'Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory' Soundtrack)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory). After this Chuck E. Cheese appears and starts singing and performing to a parody of [Hey Look Me Over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey,_Look_Me_Over_(song)). During this Munch's Make Believe Band sing about the many wonderful ways your 'Pure Imagination' can be used. They then begin wonder where they should go first with their imagination. They decide the best place they can go to is a jungle. Once they arrive and begin exploring they begin singing a song about exploring and looking for animals on their 'Jungle Parade'. They say the only way to be safe in the jungle is to 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' They then pretended their elephant trunks then saying 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' They then act like Monkey's swinging from a vine Look high, look low again. They then hear frogs and eventually get through the swamp. Eventually they go into a cave where a lion is found after that they run out of the cave while again singing the song they started with but fast then sing the 'Look high, look low. Look all around. Listen! and you'll hear lots of Junglely sounds' again.
Once they escape their make believe jungle they sing a modified version of [Danny and the Juniors- At The Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Hop). Chuck & Munch's Make Believe Band then give their goodbyes with the instrumental of the CEC version of 'Pure Imagination' slowly fading out. with the 1990 Wink sound effect playing before the show ends.
