## History

TODO: History of changes, advertisements in showtapes, ect.

### Redirect Site

[chuckecheeses.com](http://www.chuckecheeses.com/) would be a duplicate site of the main site, presumably created around the same time. In 2016 it would start redirecting to the main site instead, and by 2019 the site would close down.

### Original Blog Sub-Site

[blog.chuckecheese.com](http://blog.chuckecheese.com/), originally a redirect to the [Mouse Pad](https://www.chuckecheese.com/mouse-pad) blog on the Chuck E. Cheese website, which now gives an error. The Mouse Pad also now redirects to the current [blog page](https://www.chuckecheese.com/blogs/). This link is still referenced on the [CEC YouTube about page](https://www.youtube.com/c/chuckecheese/about).

### 'Do the Chuck E.' Site

[chuckecheese.com/dothechucke](http://chuckecheese.com/dothechucke) was a section of the site in 2015 promoting the then new 'Do the Chuck E.' dance. A new domain was created as a redirect site, being [dothechucke.com](https://www.dothechucke.com/).
