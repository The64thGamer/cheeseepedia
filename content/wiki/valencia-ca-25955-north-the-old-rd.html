<b><i>25955 North The Old Rd</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese location in Valencia, California.
The Chuck E. Cheese in Valencia, CA (also known as Stevenson Ranch) opened on March 4, 1998, with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}. It was one of the last 1-stages installed. It should not be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Valencia, CA (23154 Valencia Blvd)" >}}, which was a Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E Cheese that opened April 1983 and closed February 1996.
<h2> History </h2>
Stevenson Ranch opened on March 4, 1998 with a 1-Stage.
The 1-Stage would remain until January 2023, when the store would receive the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2018 20 Remodel Program" >}}, removing the 1-Stage in favor of a dance floor and video wall. The animatronics would be sent to the {{< wiki-link "Pasadena, CA (3737 E Foothill Blvd)" >}} location, which would have its stage and animatronics removed in their remodel in February 2024.
