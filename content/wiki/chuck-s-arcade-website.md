## History

The earliest Wayback Machine archive of the site dates to June 28th, 2025,<sup>(1)</sup> in advance of CEC officially announcing the chain on June 30th.<sup>(2)</sup> This early version of the site noticeably includes what appears to be a placeholder illustration of an arcade at the top, instead of the actual photographs that would be used later.
On or around July 1st, the site would be updated, adding a list of locations and a promotional video while also replacing the aforementioned placeholder with real location photos.<sup>(3)</sup> By the following day, it would be updated again to list the then-forthcoming Brea, CA location.<sup>(4)</sup>
