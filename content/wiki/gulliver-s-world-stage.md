Gulliver's World has a retrofitted {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} show renamed to 'The Hard Luck Bears' and is located in its own theater. the character positioning is the same to the original Rock-afire Explosion set-up except the characters themselves feature different clothing and all have replacement bear masks.

## History

TODO: go in depth The show was installed by Creative Engineering Inc. in 1992 and ran off its own custom programmed showtape produced by Gulliver's and programmed by Creative Engineering Inc.

### Restoration

On 27 February 2022 Instagram user 'xan\_rock\_afire\_fan' announced that he would be restoring all 3 of Gulliver's Hard Luck Bears shows.(1) The restoration included a full mechanical restoration, a switch to the 'BlueBox' control system and the same year the show had a soft-opening for Christmas.(2) (Though during this soft-opening the characters weren't 100% mechanically). In November 2023 internet user BensProjects created a new dress for Mitzi this features a red shirt with snow flake patterns and a white overall-skirt, she was also given blue pom-poms. On 2024/05/26 the show began to go through a wiring re-vamp changing its power system to fully run of 50HZ European power and not using a step down power converter. This also included the process of changing every light to LED instead of the original Halogen lights.
