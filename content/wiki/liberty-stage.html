The Liberty Stage is one of the few Rolfe and Earl stage rotations to exist. The stage is bare, only featuring the Statue of Liberty figure, created by Creative Presentations, and a sky-blue backdrop with clouds.
According to showbizpizza.com, the Rolfe and Earl character was retrofitted into being the statue and the stage show was mass produced for up to 170 Showbiz Pizzas, but these claims have yet been confirmed by any party involved in the creation of the show.
