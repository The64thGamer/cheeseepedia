The ***CEC Coca-Cola Triple Tabletop Ad Stand* is a *Coca-Cola* and *Chuck E. Cheese's* branded plastic red stand that was used on tables to advertise Chuck E. Cheese services, products, and promotions starting in 1995.
The stand can hold up to three advertisements, each placed in a curved holder. The stand is designed to make it hard for the ads to be taken out, usually resulting in rips, creases, and tears. Most ads shown outside the stand are usually in this condition. The stands lasted sometime until 2010, being replaced with a new design.**

## Ads
