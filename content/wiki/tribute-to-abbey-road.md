## Production

When producing the *Abbey Road* segment, CEI rented 23 musicians to perform additional instruments, specifically listed are the horns and strings. During *Louisiana,* CEI moved their drums into a warehouse for recording to provide proper reverberation. *Child of the Rock* has 15 children from a local elementary school provide the backup vocals.<sup>(1)</sup>
Three songs on the tape would be original productions by The Noize. *Louisiana* would be written by Burt 'Sal' Wilson, *Child of the Rock* would be written by Duke Chauppetta, and *Goofy Gas* by Jeff 'Claude' Howell.<sup>(0)</sup>

## Trivia

- This show was the first to feature Shalisa Sloan as the voice of Mitzi. She was only 11-years-old when she got the part.
- This show was also the first to feature Rick Bailey as a lead vocalist, although not as Beach Bear, but as the Moon in 'Golden Slumbers'. Previously, he had done instrumental work and back-up vocals for the band, but this is his first time singing lead. He would end up replacing Aaron Fechter as the voice of Beach Bear in the following showtape, {{< wiki-link "RAE Christmas '82" >}}.
- This is Aaron Fechter's final show recording any new vocals for Beach Bear. Anytime his Beach Bear voice is heard following this tape, it's through reused segments.
- All of the segments from this showtape would go on to be reused in future compilation tapes.
- At the time of it's release, the Abbey Road Medley was the longest individual segment on a Rock-afire showtape, clocking in at 14-minutes. This title has since been taken by longer tracks, however.
