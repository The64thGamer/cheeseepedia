The ***Game Room Authorized Pin* was released in 2017 with a new wave of pins. This pin was given to CEC employees for passing the 'Game Room Training Course' test, to be worn on their lanyard.**

## Design

The design is a metal pin featuring Helen Henny's head with stars on a pink ticket with text saying, 'GAME ROOM AUTHORIZED'. This design also temporarily replaced the Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar) pin. The Gameroom Certified Pin (Rockstar) had a short re-release at the start of 2023 for select stores under a slight change of design.

## Acquirement

Employees could receive this pin if they passed the Game Room Training Course test on the CEC Connect tablet.
