### Unconfirmed Stores

Two stores had some sort of Klunk part discovered at their location. Springfield with Klunk valves, and Davenport with a Klunk arm. This confirms Klunk was present at their store at some point, but it is unknown which event(s) he was used in. Davenport does mention potentially receiving a Klunk for 1983 however.https://www.newspapers.com/image/665684553/?clipping_id=55395460&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjY2NTY4NDU1MywiaWF0IjoxNjk2OTcwNDk0LCJleHAiOjE2OTcwNTY4OTR9.sClG1OZrf2KnRIxRDXP7BAdtVpv1p4YKdgIgIRQHA4Q

- {{< wiki-link "Springfield, OH (2345 Valley Loop Rd)" >}}<sup>(6)</sup>
- {{< wiki-link "Davenport, IA (903 E Kimberly Rd)" >}}<sup>(7)(0)</sup>

The Farmington Hills, MI (29955 Orchard Lake Rd) store also could have had Klunk either for this event or {{< wiki-link "The Amazing Uncle Klunk Traveling Show (Event)" >}} before its closing, due to {{< wiki-link "Chicago, IL (5030 S Kedzie Ave)" >}} having a Klunk. Farmington transferred all their animatronics to Kedzie for them to open with in November of 1984, meaning a Klunk could have potentially been one of them.
