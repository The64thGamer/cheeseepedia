## Variants

There was only one version a Beach Bear Walkaround. The way you would be able to see out of the costume was possibly through the eyes. In some pictures and videos, Beach Bear is seen wearing a wig, while in others he is not. The wig appears to be detachable. Additionally, it seems that he does not have visible ears. He has also been seen wearing different shorts in some videos.
