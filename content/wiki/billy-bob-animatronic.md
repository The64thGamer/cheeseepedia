The Billy Bob Animatronic was one of the main {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} animatronics produced by Creative Engineering Inc. The animatronic would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} on August 14th of that year.

## History

Billy Bob animatronics would continue to be produced up until 1983. The January batch would be the last used inside ShowBiz Pizza restaurants, and would be kept and stored for future openings, while Creative Engineering would continue to produce bots until June. Now with a surplus of bots, these would need to be sold to other family entertainment centers. Through the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} process, Billy Bob would be the only character not used during this process, and was ordered to be destroyed for parts.

## Design

The bot is a brown bear in yellow and red overalls, holding a guitar whittled out of a log. He has two ears, beige skin, and black claws. A bird nicknamed 'Birthday Bird' sits on the end of his guitar.
