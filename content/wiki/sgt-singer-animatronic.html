<b>Sgt. Singer</b> was an animatronic made by <b>Creative Presentations</b> for <b>Craig Singer</b> to be used in his restaurant chain called {{< wiki-link "Sgt Singer's Pizza Circus" >}}. He would play along with <b>P.T Bearum</b> and <b>Pounce D' Lion</b> on the main stage of the restaurant.
<h2> History </h2>
Sgt. Singer was produced by Creative Presentations for Craig Singer and was used in Sgt. Singer's Pizza Circus <i>sometime around</i> 1982. At some point he would be renamed to <b>Sgt. Striper</b> by Creative Presentations so that they could sell the show elsewhere branded as <b>Sgt. Striper's Review</b>.
Other known shows Sgt. Singer was in were a <b>Sgt Striper's Touring Band</b> Show in <i>Wild Horse Saloon</i> from <i>Idlewild Park</i> in <i>Ligonier, Pennsylvania</i> and a show called <b>Sgt. Striper and His Band</b> that played in <i>Mirapolis Park</i> in France.
<b>Okamoto Amusements</b> currently has the last variants of the band in their amusement park branded as <b>Circus Band</b>, with two other variants being sold off to somewhere.
While the specifics are unknown, it is well believed that aside from the animatronics held by Okamoto, all other iterations of Sgt. Striper were thrown away into junkyards.
<h2> Design </h2>
Sgt. Singer is an anthropomorphic tiger mascot with a white beard, black whiskers, blue eyes, and is holding a guitar.
<h4> Barnyard Band </h4>
This was a farm themed variant of the band. It's hard to tell from the wear and tear in the images, but it seems like Sgt. Singer wore a brown jacket with a red trim and had an orange beard instead of a white one. He also wore brown gloves and his beard may have been orange instead of white.
<h4> Beach Bums </h4>
This was a beach themed variant of the band. Sgt. Singer wore a light blue cloak of some sort that had a red trim. This variant also wore no gloves.
<h4> Circus Theme (Official name unknown) </h4>
This was a circus themed variant of the band. Sgt. Singer wore a blue vest with a red trim and yellow shoulder pads. His whiskers were white and he also wore white gloves.
