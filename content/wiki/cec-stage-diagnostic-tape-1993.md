## Trivia

- The Munch's Make Believe Band sign seen in the video is a unique 'Munch's Party Time Band' sign, which was only installed in the corporate office.
- This diagnostic tape would be digitized for DVD in 2004, when it would be a part of showtape releases until January 2007, when CEC Stage Diagnostics would be released as its own separate disc. It would be re-released once again in 2018 and would be uploaded to Navori as a digital file starting in 2023 until 2025, with the EPROM upgrade no longer allowing CEC Stage diagnostics as an option. The last store to have the CEC Stage diagnostics was {{< wiki-link "Huntington Beach, CA (15511 Edwards St)" >}}
