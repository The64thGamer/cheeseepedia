<h2>History</h2>
Modesto opened on May 18, 1981, as a Pizza Time Theatre with the new and not fully went through 'corporate' design. The only other location known to get this was San Ramon, CA. It had Harmony Howlette, Madame Oink and Helen Henny as its guest stars. Modesto was first bought out by Corporate on October 22nd, 1984, and was later refranchised not long after. Modesto later remodeled to the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}} in around 1989/1990 which included the conversion from Balcony Stage to Chuck E.'s House Facade. Modesto would have Chuck E.'s House Facade until around the Mid 1990's when they would receive {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} which involved converting Chuck E.'s House Facade into a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. On June 27, 2005, Modesto was bought out by Corporate for the second time. Then in 2006-2007, Modesto would remodel to the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} which involved the removal of Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, 90s decor, & adding purple walls. In 2010, the store expanded to add more space for games and a new showroom. Near the end of September 2023, the store would start its 2.0 Remodel. In October of the same year, the store would remove its 2-Stage, which is how the store stands to this day as of July 2024.
