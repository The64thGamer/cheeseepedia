It is located next to many businesses, all were formerly a Kmart (Which in turn was a former Globe Discount City) which opened on October 19th, 1978, and closed April 13th, 2003.
This location is known for having a Pizza Time Theatre and a ShowBiz Pizza within the same city.
Oldest operating former Pizza Time Theatre in Texas after the closure of Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd).
<h2>History</h2>
San Antonio (Military) opened in September 1981 and had a Balcony Stage. It was originally a franchised location. It survived the 1984 bankruptcy and was bought on October 22, 1984, along with many other locations by corporate. Around the Late 80's, they would receive the 1988 remodel, removing old PTT decor, for some strange reason, renamed the store to ShowBiz Pizza, and received Chuck E.'s House Facade, otherwise known as the C-Stage. The {{< wiki-link "San Antonio, TX (8220 Windsor Cross)" >}} They also removed the Waving Flags. They would later change back to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza in 1991-1992. They would receive either {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} or {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} sometime in 1997 which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights, removed older decor and removed the C-Stage for the 2-Stage. The Kmart then closed on April 13th, 2003. They would remain like this until 2010 when they received the 2005 remodel ({{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}) removing the Showroom walls, Balcony Seating, relocating and rebuilding the road sign to be in front of the store, and an expansion (Which ended up relocating the stage) (Also because the store's gameroom was tiny compared to the Showroom before the remodel<sup>(1)</sup>). The sign changed to the Phase 5 sign around 2016 because of wear and tear on the old sign. They would remain like this until they received the one of the first of the 7 2.0 remodels in July 2017 removing the 2-Stage for the Dance Floor. Strangely, they kept the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} booths but modified them. In April 2024, alongside every San Antonio location, Military dr. updated to the 2021 version of the 2.0 remodel and very strangely they also received unmodified {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} booths recently. As of July 2024, Military remains like this.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Balcony Stage like most PTT locations at the time. In the Late 80's, they would convert the Balcony into a{{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} which they had until 1997 (Same year as {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}}) when it was converted in to a 2-Stage. Chuck's Outfit was then replaced with the Tuxedo & Derby. In around 2001-2002, Chuck's Derby was replaced with the red Cool Chuck hat. In around 2005-2006; Chuck's outfit was replaced again with Cool Chuck. In 2010, the 2-Stage was relocated to a new part of the store. In 2011-2012, his outfit was replaced again with the Avenger outfit. It would remain like this until July 2017 when they received the 2.0 remodel and removed the 2-Stage for a 2017 model Dance Floor. In April 2024, they would receive the 2021 model Video Wall and Dance Floor.
