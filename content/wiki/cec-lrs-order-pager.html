The <b><i>CEC LRS Order Pager</b></i> is a tabletop electronic pager that vibrates to alert customers that their order is ready to pick up. The pager began to be used in Texas stores starting in 2017, before heading to other test markets in 2018, and by 2019 all stores acquired a set.
<h2> LRS </h2>
The <i>Long Range Systems LLC Guest Connect Note</i> is the pager used in the stores, being part of the <i>LRS Guest Connect Note Paging Kit</i><sup>(1)</sup><i>,</i> a package including 15-60 notes (It is unclear currently which count of notes stores received), a transmitter, 2 power supplies, and a lid kit for custom inserts.
<h2> Design </h2>
A custom sticker adorns the front of the pager, featuring a green background with a pizza in the middle. The top text states 'Quality takes Time. Your freshly-made pizza will be ready soon!'. Below the pizza is the Chuck E. Cheese's logo, along with a link to lrsus.com. Notably, even though the pagers were continued to be used past the brand change to just 'Chuck E. Cheese', none of the stickers were updated to accommodate the new logo.
<h2> Store Exceptions </h2>
Some locations were not able to use these pagers, as their kitchen window was inside an employee-only area, making customer pickup at the window incompatible.<ul><li>{{< wiki-link "Sharonville, OH (1429 E Kemper Rd)" >}}</li><li>{{< wiki-link "Princeton, NJ (520 Nassau Park Blvd)" >}}</li><li>{{< wiki-link "Goodyear, AZ (13371 West McDowell Rd)" >}}</li></ul>
