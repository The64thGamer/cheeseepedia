## Official Description

THE ROCK-AFIRE EXPLOSION is the true story behind one of the strangest pop culture phenomenons of the 1980s. Before being mysteriously replaced by Chuck-E-Cheese, the ShowBiz Pizza chain (and its animatronic rock band, the Rock-Afire Explosion) took the U.S. by storm and eventually inspired the hit video game Five Nights at Freddy's. This documentary chronicles the rise and fall of ShowBiz Pizza, the Rock-afire Explosion, and the obsessive fans who have kept the dream alive. Produced DIY-style by filmmakers Brett Whitcomb and Bradford Thomason (Glow: The Story of Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, THE ROCK-AFIRE EXPLOSION is a joyful and touching look at the importance of nostalgia and the eternal quest to stay young. American Genre Film Archive is excited to bring this overlooked documentary to Blu-ray for the first time, complete with enough extras to inspire a million animatronic sing-alongs.
