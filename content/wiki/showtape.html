A <b><i>Showtape</b></i> is an interchangeable storage medium that holds audio, animation data for an animatronic stage, and sometimes video. The term is also used to describe the entirety of the audio-visual experience seen from a showtape playthrough.
Showtapes allow animatronic performances to be swapped out at a company's discretion to completely change the guest experience, encouraging guests to visit multiple times a year. This can also allow special limited time performances to happen without any laborious changes to the underlying show system.
