**P.T. Bearum** was an animatronic made by **Creative Presentations** for **Craig Singer** to be used in his restaurant chain called {{< wiki-link "Sgt Singer's Pizza Circus" >}}. He would play along with **Sgt. Singer** and **Pounce D' Lion** on the main stage of the restaurant.

## History

P.T. Bearum was produced by Creative Presentations for Craig Singer and was used in Sgt. Singer's Pizza Circus *sometime around* 1982. At some point he would be rebranded by Creative Presentations so that they could sell the show elsewhere branded as **Sgt. Striper's Review**.
Another known show P.T. Bearum was in was **Sgt Striper's Touring Band** Show in *Wild Horse Saloon* from *Idlewild Park* in *Ligonier, Pennsylvania* .
**Okamoto Amusements** currently has the last variants of the band in their amusement park branded as **Circus Band**, with two other variants being sold off to somewhere.
It's known that Okamoto Amusements had at one point 3 band variants of Sgt. Singer's Band, but currently only has one left. For all the other P.T. Bearum animatronics it is unknown where they ended up, and are likely in junkyards or gone.
