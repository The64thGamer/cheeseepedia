Around 1995/1996, the location received {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}, removing all 1988 remodel elements, and changed the exterior. They later received {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} in their respective years. Springfield remained like this until 2006/2007, when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removed the showroom walls and balcony seating, added purple walls, and expanded. In around the late 2010s, the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} were removed. In October 2023 Springfield, MO would begin its 2.0 refresh. As of July 2024, Springfield remains like this with the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor with the Video Wall.
