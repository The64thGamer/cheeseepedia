The ***Colander Head Club Membership Card* was a special card produced for contributing patrons of the {{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)" >}} during the month of March 1983.
The card could be used to win prizes on Wednesday nights during the event if also wearing a colander to the restaurant.**

## Obtainability

The card was obtainable by fulfilling multiple criteria from March 1st - 31st of 1983.<sup>(1)</sup>

1.  Attend a ShowBiz Pizza Place wearing a colander on your head, encouraged to be customized and decorated but not required.
2.  Request the staff to play the {{< wiki-link "3 Birthday Shows - Colander History - Indoctrination Skit" >}} in the Showroom, or wait till Wednesday nights where the show would be played for the groups attending.
3.  Watch the skit and follow along with its instructions by taking the oath (though following along was not enforced).

A ShowBiz employee would then hand you the card. Patrons could then return each Wednesday night to receive 6 free tokens, a free coke, and a signed picture of one of the Rock-afire Explosion characters. Despite Colander Night returning in September of 1983 for the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" >}}, the membership card would not be handed out- nor used to identify members for prizes.<sup>(2)</sup>
