***Marinwood / San Rafael, CA (175 Marinwood Ave)*** was a Pizza Time Theatre that lasted from May 2nd, 1983 to 1995.

## History

In March of 1982, Pizza Time Theatre would meet with the Marin County Board of Supervisors to assess a location in the Marinwood community. While PTT had approval from the Marin Planning Commission, the board hesitated on approval due to community demands for an environmental assessment. Jeff Raleigh would represent Pizza Time Theatre alongside an attendant in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume at the hearing and say "Chuck E. Cheese is appaled by the lack of consideration of a good, family business". After the meeting, residents began shouting at eachother from both sides. Seeing this, Jeff would pull development plans for Marin County at the time.{{< cite 1 >}}
