<h2> Cylinder Rebuilding </h2>
An official procedure for cylinder rebuilding is documented in the ShowBiz Pizza Place Operations Manual from 1981.<blockquote><ol><li>Remove front or rear face of cylinder</li><li>Remove piston</li><li>Remove nose seal and 'O' rings</li><li>Clean all parts with a clean rag and denatured alcohol</li><li>Coat piston and new seals with packer lube</li><li>Install the new 'O' rings (flanges facing each other)</li><li>Coat the cylinder wall with parker 'O-ring' lube</li><li>Lube piston rod with 10 weight non-detergent oil</li><li>Reassemble NOTE: It is advisable to rebuild the cylinder on a clean piece of paper or newspaper. This will help prevent foreign matter finding its way inside your newly rebuilt cylinder.</li></ol>
