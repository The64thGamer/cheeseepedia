<b><i>Guatemala City, Guatemala (Ave La Reforma 7-62, Zona 9)</b></i> was a franchised <i>ShowBiz Pizza Place</i> that opened in 1986 and closing in 1996 a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's.</i>
Prior to {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, the location was not officially acknowledged by {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} during its early years of operation. However, unlike other international ShowBiz stores, Guatemala City may have been the only location outside the United States to be converted into a Chuck E. Cheese's.
<h2> History </h2>
This ShowBiz in particular had unique menu items, such as pizzamoffin, pizzpan, and pancakes.<sup>(1)</sup>
Prior to its relocation it was remodeled to fit 1986 SPT Remodel Program|ShowBiz Pizza Time's current appearance.
The location would relocate to {{< wiki-link "Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd LiberaciÃ³n 6-31, Zona 9)" >}} in 1996.
<h2> Stages </h2>
This location's {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} show was originally from the Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41) location, which had just closed about year prior. The show more than likely received Concept Unification prior to 1996.
