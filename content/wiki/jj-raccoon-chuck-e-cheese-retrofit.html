JJ the Raccoon is a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese. (Cyberamic)" >}} retrofit that was found at {{< wiki-link "JJ's Pizza Time Theater" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Marrero, LA (1951 Ames Blvd)" >}}.

<h2>History </h2>
During Showtime Pizza's liquidation, the Pizza Time Theater at {{< wiki-link "Marrero, LA (1951 Ames Blvd)" >}} was sold to local businessman Josh Jones and renamed to JJ's Pizza Time Theater.
The restaurant shut down sometime in 1986, and an auction was held selling off the assets of JJ's Pizza Time Theater on June 28th, 1986. The current whereabouts of JJ are unknown.

<h2>Design</h2>
The only known picture of JJ that is in black and white, however some assumptions can be made regarding color schemes. JJ appears to have dark fur that lightens around his eyes and his traditional black raccoon eye mask, a white/pale grey muzzle with a dark stripe running up it and a black nose. He appears to be wearing a tuxedo with a large circular gem in the center of his outfit.
