The <b><i>Legacy Locations</b></i> (previously referred to as the <b><i>Munch's Make-Believe Band Residency</b></i>) are a variation of the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} that keeps a store's Animatronic Stage.
6 stores to date have received the program, being the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}}, a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}}, a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}}, a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}}, a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}}, and a {{< wiki-link "Road Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd)" >}}.
<h2> Description </h2>
The <i>Legacy Locations</i> were created as an official response to the backlash from the destruction of animatronic shows from the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} by having in 2023 the {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}} store keep its {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} past its remodel, later in 2024 adding 4 additional stores to the program.
Showtapes at the locations play the same main segments and advertisements on the {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}} as other stores, but only select content and live shows released before 2023 contain programming. Stores have the ability to load up additional programmed segments as they would live shows. The Nanuet location does not feature any animatronic programming.
<h2> History & Original Concepts </h2>
The original concept for the residency was much larger than its finalized state, originally being dubbed by fans during its planning phase as the <i>Chuck E. Cheese Retro Store</i>, but officially called by CEC Corporate as the <i>Legacy Locations</i>. These were plans originally to either create a brand new museum to host all variants of CEC animatronics, or later to have a multiple separately branded stores each keeping different stages.<ref name=':0'>https://youtu.be/Z0jticFrDDs</ref> In the end, this was reduced to just five locations.
<h3> Museum Concept </h3>
At an unknown time prior to mid-2022, CEC Corporate began discussions of a possible location using permanent animatronic attractions while their stores were currently going through the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|CEC 2.0 Remodel Program. This first idealized into a possible museum being opened in Orlando, FL, with others likely being in Dallas and San Jose. These museum stores would host one of each major stage type, being {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}}, 3-Stage, and {{< wiki-link "Studio C" >}}.
<h3> Store Acquisitions </h3>
Around the time of these discussions, certain stores that were closing or going through a remodel were selected to have their items sent to the {{< wiki-link "Showbiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS)" >}} or {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Corporate Office" >}} for possible use.<ul><li>Slidell, LA (124 North Shore Blvd)</li><ul><li>October 22, 2020 - Art taken during closure.</li></ul>

<h3> Legacy Location Concept </h3>
At some point in the discussions of the museum concept however, it was pointed out that a museum would not keep customer retention for long compared to CEC's usual restaurant and party experiences.<sup>(0)</sup> The priorities then shifted to instead turning select stores back into previous remodels, mainly focused around the 1992 Major Remodel. This would reduce costs of creating brand new attractions, while still keeping the retro branded stores within usual restaurant systems and procedures. By mid-2022 however, the idea would be put on hold while the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} was still siphoning time and resources.<sup>(0)</sup>
<h3> Northridge Chosen </h3>
On July 25, 2023, {{< wiki-link "Northridge, CA (8425 Reseda Blvd)" >}} would begin to go through a remodel. After around a week of normal proceedings, it had been noted that the store's SPT Parody Awards were wrapped up behind a set of arcade machines, and its stage had not been dismantled despite the current progression of the remodel. Rumors would begin circulating that the store had suddenly gone through with a change of plans and would be keeping its animatronic show.
The {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} would continue to go through, installing the video wall and dance floor, however, the 2-Stage in the store would be kept. Many of the 1992 Major Remodel parts of the store were taken down, such as the entrance awning and checkered tiles, while the showroom shelves remained. The store's exterior sign would retain the same shape, but with the new 2.0 logo. The residency would be celebrated with the {{< wiki-link "2023 Northridge Grand Reopening Party" >}} on November 10, 2023. Fan response to the move had been mixed, with many lamenting the imminent loss of all other remaining stages across the country; this decision came with the confirmation that all other stores hosting animatronics were set for removal of the stages.<ref name=':1'>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chuck-e-cheese_creativity-innovation-entertainment-activity-7125896598227693568-wGbM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop</ref>
CEC Corporate would denote this location as important because it was 'long been visited by our fans' and 'in celebration of the location's 40th anniversary', despite the location's 40th anniversary actually having taken place 2 years prior in September of 2021.<sup>(1)</sup><ref name=':2'></ref> CEC would directly confirm that once all 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|CEC 2.0 Remodel Programs were completed across all locations, Northridge would be the only store left with animatronics.<sup>(1)</sup> They would also note the location to be permanent showcase for 'all legacy Chuck E. Cheese nostalgia'.<sup>(1)</sup> CEC would deflect all comments begging for their local stores to keep their animatronics with stating that Northridge was 'the perfect location to keep the animatronic fun going strong'.<sup>(2)</sup>
<h3> 2024 Future Planning Survey </h3>
In the {{< wiki-link "2024 CEC Future Planning Survey" >}}, the survey would ask participants about if they had visited the Northridge location. A follow up question would ask about having more locations, now referred to as 'animatronics display', closer to the participant. Participants could type any store they wish to become one, and additionally clarify why they think the location they chose would be worth keeping the animatronics.
The <i>Retro Store</i> concept would return later in the survey detailing uniquely themed CEC locations.<blockquote>'Retro Chuck E. Cheese (1980-1990s): Experience the magic of Chuck E. Cheese with a nostalgic twist! Imagine arcade classics, iconic games, memorable Chuck E. memorabilia, and a menu inspired by fan favorites. Relive the glory days with themed parties, retro music, and an ambiance that takes you straight back to the best of the 80s and 90s.'</blockquote>The choices for what would go in the restaurant are also similar to what was proposed prior.<blockquote><ul><li>'Retro décor & memorabilia</li><li>80s/90s music & karaoke nights</li><li>Retro costume nights</li><li>80s & 90s candy</li><li>Nostalgic merchandise</li><li>Interactive history exhibit</li><li>Retro arcade zone</li><li>Adult dance parties</li><li>Classic menu items</li><li>Themed birthday party packages</li><li>Retro game competitions</li><li>Vintage photo booth'</li></ul>
</blockquote>These concepts also bleed into the section of the survey on the Chuck E. Fan Club.
<h3> Nanuet Chosen </h3>
{{< wiki-link "Nanuet, NY (250 West Route 59)" >}} was chosen in May of 2024 to be the second store to keep its animatronic(s). The store had a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}. The store would also be confirmed to be receiving a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}.
<h3> Springfield, Charlotte, & Hicksville Chosen </h3>
Shortly after the decision to keep the Nanuet Studio C stage was released, CEC announced they would be keeping an additional three stages. These being the {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}}, the 3-Stage at {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}}, and the {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} at {{< wiki-link "Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}}.<sup>(3)</sup>
<h3>Ontario Chosen</h3>
On February 8th, 2025, David Mckillips and Mark Kupferman would confirm that the Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (4141 Dixie Rd) store would be made as the sixth of the CEC Legacy Locations . The store had hosted the Cyberamics Road Stage, rounding out the legacy lineup with another stage type. Kupferman commented on the store stating that they wanted to keep a stage in Canada, and given it was the last Road Stage in existence it was a good fit. Additionally, another Canadian store, Willowdale, Ontario, Canada (2452 Sheppard Ave) , would be set to keep its special Pizza Time Theatre Chuck E. statue through its remodel, though it would not be keeping its 2-Stage.<sup>(4)(5)(6)</sup>
