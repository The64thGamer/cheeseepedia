the ***Winchester Helen Henny Animatronic* was an animatronic version of {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny" >}} created in August 1977 by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest" >}} for the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}}. The Bot was removed in February 1978, when {{< wiki-link "Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic)" >}} was installed.**

## History

### Production

In August 1977, Pizza Time Theatre had finalized their 'Guest Star' concept with the creation of Helen Henny. They tasked Fantasy Forest with creating the Bot.

### At Winchester

The Bot was installed at the Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} on August 12th, 1977<sup>(1)</sup>. The Bot was installed with the {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny Showtape" >}}. The Bot was replaced in February 1978 when {{< wiki-link "Winchester Madam Oink (Animatronic)" >}} was installed.

### Fate

The fate of Winchester Helen is unknown as no photos of The Bot at {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Sunnyvale, CA Corporate Office" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Cupertino, CA Corporate Office" >}}, or any other PTT Corporate location have been found. The Bot is possibly the same as {{< wiki-link "Kooser Helen Henny (Animatronic)" >}}, as the bots share the same design. The bot was most likely destroyed during the move to the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}

## Design

The Bot had long brown hair, brown eyes, yellow hands with red painted fingernails, a black necklace with a gold medallion, and wears a white shirt with a purple vest over it.
