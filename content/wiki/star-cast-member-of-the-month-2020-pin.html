The <b><i>Star Cast Member of the Month 2020 Pin</b></i> was given to CEC employees for their contributions in the store, to be worn on their lanyard.
<h2>Design</h2>
The design is a golden star with <i>Rockstar Chuck E.</i> raising his arms in triumph. The year is at the top in purple, while the title is printed onto a white box. The pin is metal, with a black color. All parts on the pin are painted, compensating for the lack of gold metal to be used as the star color. The text on the pin says:
<code>2020 STAR CAST MEMBER OF THE MONTH</code>
<h2>Acquirement</h2>
Employees could receive this pin by being the most outstanding cast member out of all employees for the month. Similar to the standard 'Employee of the Month' rewards given at other businesses. This reward was at the manager's discretion, and could even not be given out for the month.
