The ***CEC Digital Menu Software*** is a remote software used to display changing menus across Chuck E. Cheese locations. It began deployment some time before 2019, and was mass installed by 2019.

The menus are controlled two different ways depending on the store. The initial software is NCR Voyix's proprietary digital signage software. {{< cite 1 >}} When the {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} was installed in stores in 2022, some would move over to being run entirely by Navori. It is unclear as of 2025 what ratio of stores have either system installed.
