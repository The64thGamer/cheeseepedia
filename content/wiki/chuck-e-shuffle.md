***Chuck E. Shuffle*** is a generic live show released in April 1994. This live show would be re-edited for Studio C stages in September 2001 by {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Shuffle 2001" >}}, while Existing Stages would continue playing the 1994 version through the end of 2002.

## Summary

The countdown starts with Chuck E. backstage ordering a pizza as someone tells him he has five minutes until the live show. In between the segments with Chuck E. during the countdown, footage of various pieces of CEC merch is shown. At four minutes, Chuck E. is getting his hair done. At three minutes, Chuck E. is getting his makeup done. At two minutes, Chuck E. walks out of the makeup department. At the end of the countdown, kids are heard chanting Chuck E.’s name as he walks into the kitchen and tries to eat a pizza meant for the guests. A cast member then comes in and tells Chuck E. it’s showtime and adjusts his bowtie. As Chuck E. leaves the room, another cast member tells him to ‘break a leg", which he finds confusing until it’s explained that it means good luck. Chuck E. then walks into the showroom, and an announcer starts the live show. At the end, kids are heard chanting Chuck E.’s name.

## Live Trivia:

- {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Holiday Party 2001" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Summer 2002 Show" >}} both included the original version of ‘Chuck E. Shuffle’ instead of the 2001 re-edit due to those shows reusing DVDs.
