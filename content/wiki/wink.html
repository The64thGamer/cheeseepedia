<b>The Wink</b> is an animatronic figure created by Diversied Designs<sup>(1)</sup> for Showbiz Pizza and Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza locations from 1990 to 1998 as a part of Concept Unification, which turned the Rock-Afire Explosion into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. The Wink is an emblem of Chuck E. colored gold and winks at the end of segments or songs. It is on the valence of center stage. The Wink mechanism used the airline from Antioch from the Rock-afire Explosion<sup>(2)</sup> and was eventually incorporated into the design of multiple Cyberamic stages.<sup>(3)</sup>
<h2> History </h2>
The Wink debuted with the Concept Unification retrofit in 1990.<sup>(4)</sup>
The ribbons next to the Chuck E. head originally read 'In Pizza We Trust' but complaints were given about the phrase regarding religion and the actual phrase 'In God We Trust' so existing winks with this phrase were retrofitted just to have red and white ribbons covering up the offending phrase starting in 1992. <sup>(5)</sup> Some stores did not cover 'In Pizza We Trust' with the red and white ribbons. Starting in 1992 CEC would produce a smaller variant of the wink which would most commonly be installed on 2-Stages and 1-Stages. Winks reused on the Concept Unification Stage In 2023 the wink would appear on the promotional poster for Northridge, CA Legacy Grand Re-Opening featuring the red and white stripes.<sup>(6)</sup> Then in 2024, the wink would again appear on the promotional poster for Charlotte, North Carolina (Pineville) featuring the 'In Pizza We Trust' text instead of the red and white ribbon design. <sup>(7)</sup> This would be the first time CEC would ever reference the 'In Pizza We Trust' text since 1992.
<h2> Design </h2>
<h3> 1990 Wink </h3>

This version was the first version of the Wink made, it features Chuck E. Cheese in the middle, who winks his left eye, and to the left and right of him are the words 'In Pizza We Trust', a play on the phrase 'In God We Trust', with two stars on each side. Below Chuck E.'s head is his signature reading 'Chuck E. Cheese. There is also a TM symbol under the 'We' part. This version was manufactured from 1990 to 1992. <sup>(8)</sup> 
<h3> 1992 Wink </h3>

This version was the second version of the Wink made, it is the same as the 3-Stage, except the 'In Pizza We Trust' was never in this version. There is only 1 star on each side, the Chuck E. Cheese signature is also not featured on this version, making it smaller than its Concept Unification counterpart. This version was manufactured from around 1992 to 1998. <sup>(9)</sup> 
<h3> Colored Wink </h3>

This version was identical to the 3-Stage Wink, except the entire Wink is painted in unique colors. These were done by the store's techs and were not officially produced by CEC Entertainment. The stores that had painted winks were in {{< wiki-link "Mobile, AL (710 Downtowner Loop)" >}},<sup>(10)</sup>  {{< wiki-link "Birmingham, AL (9325 Parkway East)" >}}, <sup>(11)</sup>  and {{< wiki-link "Huntsville, AL (1220 Jordan Lane)" >}}<sup>(12)</sup> . After the closure of Birmingham (Roebuck) in November 2007, their Wink was sent to the {{< wiki-link "Madison, TN (2070 Gallatin Pike)" >}} location. On March 26, 2023, Huntsville, AL would remove its 3-Stage which included its Colored Wink, making them now extinct. Some stages have a variant of colored winks but this is only in the derby being red. The known stores are Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)<sup>(13)</sup>  and Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd)<sup>(14)</sup> . Tallahassee, FL would remove its 3-Stage which included the 1992 wink with a colored hat this would be the last. It was removed during their 2.0 remodel on May 5, 2024.
