The **PBS Kids Sponsorship** was a CEC Decor piece released for Chuck E. Cheese's Location's in 2005 and was found at countless Chuck E. Cheese Locations for their sponsorship with PBS Kids.

## History

This Poster released alongside countless Phase 4 Decor pieces, but this one was a sponsorship that Chuck E. Cheese was doing at the time with PBS Kid's and would be apart of the remodel until the location closed or remodeled into 2.0.

## Design 

The Poster featured Chuck E. Cheese with a ball in his hand with Helen Henny on the monkey bars with another kid is on the monkey bars too. the characters would also be featured on a page of a book. there would also be text on the bottom of the decor that would read "Chuck E. Cheese's is a proud sponsor of PBS Kids"
