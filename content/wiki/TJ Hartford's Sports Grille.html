<b><i>TJ Hartford's Grill & Bar</b></i> (Formerly <b><i>TJ Hartford's</b></i> <b><i>Sports Grille)</b></i> was a single restaurant and company created by <b><i>CEC Corporate</b></i> on October 1, 2001 and lasting to February 17, 2008.<ref name=':0'>https://web.archive.org/web/20020605030127fw_/http://www.tjhartfords.com/company.html</ref><sup>(1)</sup>
The only location was located at <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Lewisville, TX (1960 S Stemmons Fwy)" >}}">Lewisville, TX (1960 S Stemmons Fwy)</a>.
<h2> History </h2>
TJ Hartford's would begin as a concept within CEC Corporate to grow their restaurant business. As a juxtaposition to Chuck E. Cheese's children-centered marketing strategy, TJ's would appeal to an adult demographic by being a large contemporary dining restaurant- including a bar and multiple dozen TV's scattered throughout the building for sports entertainment. CEC Corporate considered TJ's to be '-a new expansion vehicle to compliment our future growth strategy'.<ref name=':1'>https://web.archive.org/web/20020605030127/http://www.tjhartfords.com/company.html</ref>
The company would be created as <b><i>TJH Restaurant Group, Inc.</b></i> in 2001. The first location would open on October 1, 2001<ref name=':0' />, though another source also states September 2001- possibly a soft opening.<sup>(2)</sup> The restaurant would feature arcade games for additional entertainment, crafting special tokens for the machines. At some point the company would switch to quarters for play.<sup>(3)</sup>
Plans to open a second TJ's in 2002 would be considered, but never materialized.<sup>(4)</sup>
<h3> Rebrand </h3>
By April of 2003 the company's logo would change from a more fancy design to a rougher bolder look, alongside its name changed from <i>TJ Hartford's Grill & Bar</i> to <i>TJ Hartford's Sports Grille.</i> The company's website would also be given a brighter and flashier look, now with the slogan 'The Grill is on.' <sup>(5)</sup>
<h3> Marketing Changes </h3>
By mid-June of 2004, the company would reduce the cost for playing its arcade games from a quarter down to a nickel. A kids menu would also now be featured in the restaurant, alongside Happy Hour drink specials.<sup>(6)</sup> By November 29th of 2004 the company would begin offering fundraising parties for companies, where 10% of proceeds from food purchased would be given to the organization. By November 4th of 2006, the location would now offer late night specials.<sup>(7)</sup>
<h3> Closure </h3>
The store would close on February 17, 2008.<ref name=':0' /> The location, its equipment, and its land would sell in April of 2008 for $1.3 million. In connection with the sale, a $0.8 million grain was also had with 'Other operating expenses'.<sup>(8)</sup>
