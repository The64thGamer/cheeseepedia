<h2>History</h2>
Bossier City's CEC opened on November 23, 1992 with the 1988 remodel and the 2-Stage. Strangely, when they received all 3 Phases within their respective years, many aspects of the 1988 remodel stayed behind, including checkers, awnings, and the neon signage. In 2007, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included removing all older decor for newer decor, tearing down the showroom walls and balcony seating, got rid of all 1988 remodel elements, changed the exterior, and removed the dim lighting. Bossier City remained like this until May 2013 (day unknown), when they relocated 2 miles away to Viking Drive. The location remained abandoned for a few years until 2015/2016, when a Kid to Kid store opened on the space. As of July 2023, Kid to Kid remains operational.
