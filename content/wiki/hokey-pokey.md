***'Hokey Pokey'*** was a road show which was first released in April 2004 on the {{< wiki-link "Road Show 2004" >}} CD and played through December 31, 2004. It would then return with the {{< wiki-link "Road Show 2007" >}} CD in January 2007, which played until November 30, 2007. 

## Choreography Video
A choreography video was released when the live show returned in 2007, featuring Chuck E. and two cast members. This video could be played like a standard live show on Studio C and was the only way to play this live in the showroom, though it was only intended for use after store hours.
