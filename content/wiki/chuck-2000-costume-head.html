The Chuck E. Cheese walkaround was completely overhauled once again in mid 2000. It featured a new smaller, head sculpt, the removal of the bowtie holes, and a new, thicker teeth mold. The eyelids on the head remained a light gray color, carrying over from the 1999 update. This head sculpt would be used until 2008.
