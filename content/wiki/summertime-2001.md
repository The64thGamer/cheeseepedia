## Production

#### Filming Locations

- 'Row Your Boat' was filmed at White Rock Creek in Dallas, Texas.

#### Studio C Floppy:

This show's floppy disk for Studio C removed the system files for the karaoke feature. When inserting the upgrade floppy, a message would appear on the screen saying
" SUMMER 2001 "SUMMERTIME" SHOW UPDATE FINISHED
 !!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!
 KARAOKE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED
 THIS UPDATE REMOVED KARAOKE FILES AND SYSTEM OPERATIONS
 IF YOU HAD KARAOKE MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS
 !!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!
 IF YOU DID NOT HAVE KARAOKE, NO CHANGES WERE MADE

 REMOVE FLOPPY DISK AND RESET (REBOOT) THE COMPUTER"

## Trivia:

- The footage from 'Don't Hurry to Worry' is originally from the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's 20th Anniversary" >}} with the footage being re-edited to sync better up with the new audio recorded. <sup>(1)</sup>
- 'Rockin' Christmas Eve' and 'America '99' both appear on the Studio C DVDs but could not be played.
