<b><i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory</b></i> is an <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy-Bake_Oven"> Easy-Bake Oven</a></i> styled pizza maker released in 1999.
The product was made by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham-O"> Wham-O</a></i> and stayed in production for an undetermined amount of time. A similar product, Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Maker Play Set, would show up later using <i>Avenger Chuck</i>'s design, being made by <i>EZ-2 Make.</i>

The product would come with the oven, which had a storage shelf built into its side, along with two pizza trays, a claw to grab the trays out of the oven, a plastic pizza cutter, and four <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> tokens. No pizza ingredients were included, requiring the purchase of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory Refills. These refills would be enough to make two pizzas, though also came with 10 free <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> tickets inside.
The ingredients included were referred to as:<ul><li><i>Scrumptious Sauce Packets</i></li><li><i>Super-Duper Dough Packets</i></li><li><i>Zippy Cheese Packets</i></li><li><i>Tasty Pepperoni Packet</i></li></ul>
