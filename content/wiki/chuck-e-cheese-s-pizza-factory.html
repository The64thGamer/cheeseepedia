<b><i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Factory</b></i> is an <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy-Bake_Oven"> Easy-Bake Oven</a></i> styled pizza maker released in 1999.
The product was made by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham-O"> Wham-O</a></i> and stayed in production for an undetermined amount of time. A similar product, Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Maker Play Set, would show up later using <i>Avenger Chuck</i>'s design, being made by <i>EZ-2 Make.</i>
