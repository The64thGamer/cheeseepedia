The ***Cheese Crawl*** was the first themed attraction for Pizza Time Theatre and a mainstay of its early locations, first appearing at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} on May 17th, 1977, and lasting for an unknown amount of years.

## History

By the early 1980's the Cheese Crawl would become standardized with the same layout in each store.
