<h2>Roblox Event</h2>
Starting October 7th of 2023, the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13743608986/FREE-UGC-Pi-ata-Smashlings"> Piñata Smashlings Roblox Experience</a> added a new area to its map called 'Chuck E. Cheese's Fun Fair', an outdoor theme-park themed area. Its main function is for users to spin a prize wheel to obtain exclusive CEC items in-game, alongside Roblox UGC items that can be work in any Roblox Experience.<sup>(2)</sup><sup>(3)</sup>
<h3> Ticket Earning </h3>
To spin the wheel, users must play the game to earn an exclusive currency for the event: Red Tickets. Red tickets are found by destroying Guitar Smashables found throughout the game world. These new Smashables are CEC branded piñatas in the shape of a guitar. As the player levels up, they will be able to destroy the piñatas faster, alongside being able to traverse the game world faster to find them. The Fun Fair also has trampolines, that when jumped on, reward the user with about 500 tickets every 5 mins. Users could also obtain Red Tickets by joining the game's Roblox Group during the weekend of October 7-8. This would give them 15,000 tickets, equivalent to 2-3 hours of grinding tickets in-game.
<h3> Wheel Spinning </h3>
The wheel takes 500 Red Tickets to spin, and has 10 different prizes.<ul><li>Pasqually Piñata Smashling</li><li>Mr. Munch Piñata Smashling</li><li>Jasper T. Jowls Piñata Smashling</li><li>Helen Henny Piñata Smashling</li><li>Chuck E. Cheese Piñata Smashling</li><li>Bella B. Bunny Piñata Smashling</li><li>1,000 Candy Currency</li><li>3,000 Candy Currency</li><li>Free UGC item #1</li><li>Free UGC item #2</li></ul>
The wheel is rigged with unknown weights to give each prize a different rarity. Jasper and Pasqually are considered 'Common', Munch is considered 'Uncommon', Helen is considered 'Rare', Chuck E. is considered 'Legendary', and Bella is considered 'Epic'. From in-game play, it seems the Candy Currency is also commonly won, and the UGC items are around the Legendary to Epic range in rarity.
<h3> Weekend UGC Items </h3>
Through every weekend from October 7 to December 31, two different Limited UGC items are placed on the wheel. Each UGC item only has 1,500 in stock, and are trade locked for 30 days before they can be sold in the Roblox economy. If its only the first day of the weekend, or if a UGC item has run out on the wheel, the user won't be able to roll the empty space.
UGC items are unlocked at 1pm EST each day of the weekend. The UGC items will usually run out before 11am of the next day.<ul><li>October 7 - <a href="https://www.roblox.com/catalog/14974761237/Chuck-E-Smashling-Companion"> Chuck E, Smashling Companion</a></li><li>October 8 - <a href="https://www.roblox.com/catalog/14974766829/Chuck-E-s-Ears"> Chuck E.'s Ears</a></li><li>October 14 - <a href="https://www.roblox.com/catalog/15037111676/Bella-B-Smashling-Companion"> Bella B.

<h3> CEC In-game Smashlings </h3>
All of the In-game Smashlings won at the prize wheel function exactly like standard Smashlings in the game, being used in the players party to increase their power level. Duplicates won at the wheel can be combined to level up the Smashling, which can change their appearance from Basic to Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Bubblegum.
