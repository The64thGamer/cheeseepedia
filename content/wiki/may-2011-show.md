## Trivia
- The classic CEC Wink audio plays after every segment on the Existing Stage version of the show. This show played during the 20th anniversary of this audio, which debuted with {{< wiki-link "CEC Games" >}} in July 1991.
- Robert Gotcher previously provided Jasper's speaking voice for {{< wiki-link "Environment '92" >}}.
- Duncan Brannan was initially considered to become Jasper's new voice before landing on Robert. Duncan had previously done Jasper's singing in {{< wiki-link "Let The Good Times Roll" >}} and voiced him for {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Magical Holiday Celebration" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's Jukebox Jam Show" >}} and a brief bit of dialogue during 'Sharp Dressed Mouse' in the {{< wiki-link "August 1997 Show" >}}.
- During segment four, Matt Daniel appears under the alias of Jiggawatt and introduces the audience to the concept of music mashups. This was done as a promotion for Matt's own mashups, which were uploaded to the internet around this same time under the ‘Jiggawatt’ name.
- Footage of the walkaround costumes dancing in front of a DeLorean was filmed but went unused. This was originally going to be used during the fourth segment when 'Jiggawatt' plays a mashup of the vocals from 'Walk The Dinosaur' and the instrumental from 'We Got The Beat'.
