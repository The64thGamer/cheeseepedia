<b><i>Queenie / Mini Mozzarella</b></i> was an animatronic created for the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} show and debuted at the 1978 IAAPA.
She uses the same mask mold as {{< wiki-link "Grandma Bear (Animatronic)" >}}/Beatrice from the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}} and a nearly identical mech as Mama Grandbags from the {{< wiki-link "Hard Luck Bears" >}}.
<h2> History </h2>
During the creation of the {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}} in 1980, Queenie was going to be reused as a character much like the rest of the Wolf Pack 5. However, marketing executive for {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}}, Stan Emmerson suggested replacing her with a mouse to go with the pizza theme and because {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} and Disney both had mouse mascots. In an attempt to not come off as arrogant, Aaron Fetcher allowed for Queenie to be converted into Mini Mozzarella.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> Design </h2>
Queenie is a red fox positioned on the far right of the stage. At the 1978 IAAPA, she wore a dark blue scarf, light blue button-up shirt, black jeans, and black and white saddle shoes. After the 1979 IAAPA, she wore a white shirt, skirt with various colors depending on location, black and white saddle shoes, and a rose in her right hand. This would become the standard design. During her conversion to Mini, she would be given a mouse tail.
