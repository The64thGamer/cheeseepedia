The ***Atari Family Game Center* (Also known as the ***Atari Leisure Time Game Center*<sup>(1)</sup> and ***Atari Game Center*<sup>(2)</sup>), was a set of mall arcades predating the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} concept from April of 1974 to Spring of 1975.<sup>(3)</sup>
The arcades would exclusively house Atari arcade games, built with custom cabinets to fit the interior design of the locations. The locations would also offer pinball machines and a variety of board games to play. Patrons could also purchase their own Atari arcades from the store for individual use or for small private organizations.https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/jerry_donaldson/interview_jerry_donaldson.html<sup>(4)</sup>******
