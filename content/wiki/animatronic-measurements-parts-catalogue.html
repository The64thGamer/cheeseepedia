This is an in-development project to provide all known measurements and parts for animatronics to use in repair, digitization, or producing new mechs. Very little has been archived at this point, and we encourage everyone to help contribute what they can.
<br>
All measurements and part lists will be catalogued here until enough is created that they can be separated into distinct pages. Eventually the plan is to have full Cyberamic or CEI bot .stl and .step files for use in ordering new aluminum cut parts or for 3D printing.
<br>
The citations tab contains some of the first .step files being crafted from the starting measurements.

<h2>Current Measurements</h2>
<ul>
<li>3-Stage Chuck elbow & upper arm measurements - Complete with nothing missing.</li>
<li>Cyberamic upper torso & head measurements - From testing the measurements seem very inaccurate, and not everything is measured, needs a complete rework.</li>
<li>Daniel & The Dixie Diggers: Daniel head measurements - Accurate but missing a lot of measurements, including metal thickness, arrangement of metal pieces, and screw hole sizes.</li>
</ul>
