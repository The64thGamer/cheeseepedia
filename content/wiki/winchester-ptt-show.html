The <b><i>Winchester Pizza Time Theatre Show</b></i> was a set of animatronics built exclusively for the first Pizza Time Theatre location at {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)">}} and used from May 17th, 1977 to sometime between 1980 and 1981 when they were replaced with {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics">}}.
<br>
The show consisted of the main characters and moving props placed along the bannisters of the showroom, with the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Warblettes (Animatronic)">}} hung below the ceiling.
<h2> History </h2>
All characters were produced by {{< wiki-link "Fantasy Forest">}}, mainly by its owner Harold Goldbrandsen. Fantasy Forest was previously a mascot costume manufacturer, making the Winchester show their first animatronic products created. Atari's Cyan Engineering (also known as the Grass Valley Team) would handle the creation of the {{< wiki-link "Winchester Control System">}}, headed by Larry Emmons and Gary Waters.<sup>(1)</sup>
<h2> Animatronics </h2>
The {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese Proof of Concept Prototype (Animatronic)">}} was initially built as a concept piece for the location, but was never intended to be used inside the building.
<br>
The main animatronics and their locations were:
<ul>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Chuck E. Cheese V1 (Animatronic)">}} (South West Corner)</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Crusty the Cat V1 (Animatronic)">}} (South East Corner)</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Pasqually (Animatronic)">}} (North Bannister)</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Jasper T. Jowls (Animatronic)">}} (East Bannister)</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Warblettes (Animatronic)">}} (Hung below ceiling in the
            center)</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Pizza Time Orchestra (Animatronic)">}} (Along East and South
            Bannisters)</li>

    <li>{{< wiki-link "Winchester Applause Board (Animatronic)">}} (West Bannister)</li>
