<b><i>822 W McKinley Ave</b></i> is a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on September 22, 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day.
This location is located in the Town & Country Shopping Center. They would receive Concept Unification in 1991 or 1992, and removed the 3-Stage in 2018 after it caught on fire and then the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor in July 2019.
<h2>History</h2>
Mishawaka opened on September 22nd, 1982, as part of an expansion of the shopping center it was in. Unfortunately, there is not much info on this location as a ShowBiz Pizza. This location had the Rock-Afire Explosion Classic Stage. In 1988 or 1989, Mishawaka received the 1988 remodel removing older SPP decor for newer decor, and the change to the Billy Bob Stage (ShowBiz Pizza Campground). Around 1991, Mishawaka would receive Concept Unification and receive the Concept Unification decor and a new exterior. In the Mid 1990's, Mishawaka would receive either {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} or {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} which added a lot of 1990s decor and assets such as the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. In the late 90's, Mishawaka would receive the Phase 3 remodel which got a new exterior (Which involved an expansion of the front of the store to make room for more games) and most of the 90s decor was removed and the 2000's decor and SkyTubes were added. In 2006, they would swap their animatronics out with ones from the recently closed Joliet, IL store. In June 2007, it would undergo the 2005 remodel which involved the exterior, the removal of the early 2000's posters, and the new decor. In Mid 2018, the 3-Stage caught on fire. Mishawaka would remain this way until July 2019, when they would undergo the 2.0 remodel removing the burned 3-Stage for the Dance Floor. Currently, as of February 2023, the location still has the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.
<h2>Stages</h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion. In 1991 or 1992, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters. In 2006, Mishawaka’s animatronics were swapped out with ones from the recently closed Joliet IL store. In 2018, the 3-Stage caught on fire and was removed in July 2019 when it would undergo the 2.0 remodel for the Dance Floor. They still have the Dance Floor to this very day.
