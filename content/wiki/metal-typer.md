***Metal Typer*** was a mechanical arcade produced by Standard Metal Typer, Inc. which was used in early Pizza Time Theatre's. The machine allowed customers to stamp a metal disc with letters.{{< cite 1 >}}

## Gameplay

Metal Typers came in multiple denominations of coins over the years, with Pizza Time Theatre's likely being the 25c or multi-quarter/token variant.{{< cite 2 >}} Customers would insert a token and the machine would allow them to stamp 32 characters (including spaces) onto the circular rim of a metal disk. {{< cite 1 >}}

The disk itself was aluminum and came in either a variety of colors or just silver (it is unclear which batch Pizza Time Theatre ordered). The disk as far as is known was the generic Metal Typer disk and not a Pizza Time Theatre variant, as no PTT branded disks have been found. The disks either had "Good Luck" stamped in the middle with a horseshoe or four-leaf clover, or "Lucky" with a star. Pre-stamped disks would be shown in the display, but the customer wouldn't know which color they would recieve if it was a variety pack inside.
