The **Yogi Bear Stage** was installed three Showbiz Pizza Place locations ({{< wiki-link "Omaha, NE (225 N 76th St)" >}},{{< wiki-link "Colorado Springs, CO (5156 N Academy Blvd)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Augusta, GA (3435 Wrightsboro Rd)" >}}). in September 1987 through November 1987. That same month the Yogi Bear stage would be reverted back to the classic stage. This was an effort enhance the appeal of the Rock-afire Explosion with the test marketing of licensed characters. This was done as the newly merged company was regaining its financial foothold.

## Stage Features
Yogi Bear used Billy Bob's stage which was transformed into JellyStone Park and was a modification of the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Campground" >}} and would retain Looney Bird's green barrel and the center stage tree line. The Gas Pump or Showbiz Pizza Campground sign and pole would be removed.  Yogi Bear would be an retrofitted Rolfe Dewolfs mech and Boo Boo would be a retrofitted Looney Bird animatronic. The center stage tree line was removed and placed on Billy Bob's stage giving it a forested appearance. Looney Bird's barrel was repainted green and occupied by Boo-Boo Bear, and a large 'JellyStone Park' sign was hung behind the characters. The other unique props added to the stage was a boulder with a picnic basket placed upon it, and a sign that hung on Boo-Boo's barrel that read 'Keep Your Park Clean'. Floor floods, ceiling flood  and Billy Bob's valance were retained.
