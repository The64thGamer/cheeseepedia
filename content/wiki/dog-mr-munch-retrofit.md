## History

### As Mr. Munch

The bot was originally produced somewhere from 1981 to 1982 & was placed at the Pizza Time Theatre on {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} in July 1982. The bot had standard PTT attire. In 1993, The bot would gain new CEC styled cosmetics when Chico got their {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. The bot also replaced its former arm mechanics for new arm mechanics

### As The Dog

In January 2011, The Chuck E. Cheese's in {{< wiki-link "Chico, CA (966 East Ave)" >}} lost its license to run as a CEC, forcing them to change their branding to Fun Zone & Pizza. They converted their Munch's Make Believe Band characters into generic animals, The Dog uses a generic mascot costume instead of the Munch Cyberamic ones, though they still had the originally Keyboard from their 2-Stage. The bot's head had a tin can either over it or replacing its former one.
When Fun Zone & Pizza closed in September 2011, the characters were stripped from their cosmetics and removed and sold in a group for $100. It is unknown if anybody purchased them or where they are today.
