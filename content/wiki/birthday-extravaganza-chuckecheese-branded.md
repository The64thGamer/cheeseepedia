***Birthday Extravaganza (Chuck E. Cheese Branded)*** was first released in July 1989 for Chuck E. Cheese locations with the Pizza Time Players.
It would be available as a "Special" for stores with reels and as a "Hidden Birthday" for SVHS stores until February 1992, when it would be replaced by {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '92" >}}. 

## Summary
Chuck E. Cheese states, "I've got an announcement to make, cause dis is a very special day!" leading to the rest of the group making their guesses, with Helen finally guessing, "Wait, I know! It must be someb-b-body's birthday!" The birthday cakes are then brought out for all the birthday guests. Chuck E. Cheese then talks about the special guests and their special day, followed by singing Happy Birthday to You. 
After blowing out their candles, the Pizza Time Players sing "We Just Wanna Say Happy Birthday to You," followed by the band singing "From Chuck E. Cheese, Where a Kid Can be a Kid!" Then Chuck E. Cheese and the rest of the Pizza Time Players let the special guest know the "Birthday Helpers" can help! Such as cleaning your table, carrying presents to your car, or even giving Munch pizza.
The performance ends with all of the Pizza Time Players shouting "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"
