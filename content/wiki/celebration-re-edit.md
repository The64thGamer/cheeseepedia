## Summary

The live show starts with a five-minute countdown featuring Larry the Technician getting ready for the live show. At five minutes, Larry introduces himself and his importance to the show, then makes some "fine-tuning" which causes a small fire. At four minutes, Larry tests out the sound system and holds up a sign that reads "PLEASE STAND BY" after no sound comes out of it. At three minutes, Larry makes final lighting adjustments, which cause the power to go out. At two minutes, Larry has to get Chuck E.'s costume to him and pulls it off the rack, but finds it is completely stiff. At one minute, Larry talks about how much he has to do for the live show; Larry then plugs something in, which short-circuits and electrocutes him, though he is able to get up to announce that there is one minute left until the live show. When the countdown finishes, the band does their cover of Celebration.
