The <b><i>Chuck 2005 Costume Head</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese costume head released around the middle of 2005.
<h2> History </h2>
Mid 2005 saw the release of the new style Chuck E. Cheese walkaround head. This head is one of the most heavily used, sporting slick short fur instead of long gray fur. Beginning in Spring 2004 every new walkaround Chuck head came with a green avenger hat and would continue until 2012. This head sculpt is the same as the 2000 model and still has the same light gray eyelids.
