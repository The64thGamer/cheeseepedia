## Production

During the 20th anniversary for Chuck E. Cheese's, SPT introduced various promotional items though out the year of 1997.
K&L enterprises obtained the license to create ceramic products for ShowBiz Pizza Time and released this cookie jar as one of the first limited releases of a Chuck E. Cheese's product.

## Design

The cookie jar is based off of Chuck E. Cheese's 'Tuxedo Era', with Chuck E. holding a large cake reading 'Chuck E. Cheese's 20th Anniversary' on the front and a small pile of tokens on the top.
The cookie jar is accessed by Chuck E.'s head being removed, revealing the hallow inside of the figure to allow for maximum storage.
