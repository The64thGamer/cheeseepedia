The <b><i>15T Compressor System Video Tape</b></i> was a training tape released in 1992 detailing how to service the 3-Stage <i>Ingersoll Rand</i> compressor.
The only account of the tape's contents comes from a private owner, stating that the main portion of the video features a technician explaining how the compressor works, along with how to service it. A video from <i>Ingersoll Rand</i> themselves is also features, going over similar issues and breakdowns of the compressor.<sup>(1)</sup> The claim also states another private owner having a {{< wiki-link "15T Compressor System Video Tape 1993 Rerelease" >}} of the tape under the <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i> branding, presumably only on the tape's label.
