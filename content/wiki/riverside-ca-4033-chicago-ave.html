<b><i>4033 Chicago Ave</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened in 1981/1982 (date unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed in April 1996 (day unknown) with either a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} or {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}.
This is not to be confused with the short-lived {{< wiki-link "Riverside, CA (10121 Hole Ave)" >}}, which opened around the same time and closed in 1984 (month and day unknown with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Riverside at first had a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. Around 1989/1990, it was replaced with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. It is rumored that it had a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}, but this is currently unconfirmed. After closure, their bots were sent to {{< wiki-link "Sandy, UT (10535 So State St)" >}} for their grand opening, and after closure, the bots were used for parts at {{< wiki-link "Orem, UT (40 E Center St)" >}}. After the 2017 closure of Orem, the fate of the Cyberamics is unknown.

<h2> History </h2>
Riverside opened in 1981/1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and was in an unnamed shopping center. Unfortunately, info on Riverside in general is scarce. In 1989/1990, the location received the 1988 remodel, removing all PTT decor, added checkers around the store, changed the exterior, and removed the Balcony Stage for {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. In 1994, Riverside would be remodeled to the 1992 remodel with Phase 3, possibly removing the C Stage and possibly adding SkyTubes, and Kid Check. This remodel also removed the waving flags and 1988 decor. It is unknown if this location ever received a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}. Riverside remained like this until April 1996 (day unknown), when they would close permanently. The building was later split up into multiple businesses, all still reside today.
