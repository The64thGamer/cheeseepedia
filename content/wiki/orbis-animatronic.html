The O.R.B.I.S animatronic, Onboard Radar and Bearings Intelligence System, is described as the Awesome Adventure Machine's navigational tracking system keeps Chuck E. on course and out of trouble.
<h2> Design </h2>
O.R.B.I.S is a basket ball hoop with a radar dish, telephone, and motorized globe with accessories attached to it. The globe has a red spiral surrounding it, with miniature soccer ball at the most bottom. What seemingly makes the O.R.B.I.S's face is two clocks that sit above the globe and a smile made of tubing and two whiffle balls under it.
