***Ronald McDonald* was an animatronic created in 1984 by Setmakers and AVG Technologies for the {{< wiki-link "Ronald McDonald in a Hot Air Balloon" >}} display in McDonalds locations.
It is unknown how many were produced or how long they lasted in the stores. The only confirmed installation was at a Glendale, Coloado store in 1984.**
