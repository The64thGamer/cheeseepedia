- 'Spring Cleaning' is reused from {{< wiki-link "Spring Break" >}} and the kaleidoscope countdown is reused from {{< wiki-link "September 2003 Show" >}}
- The countdowns reuse footage from {{< wiki-link "April 2002 Show" >}}, {{< wiki-link "September 2002 Show" >}} and 'Footloose' live.
- The Play-Doh spot uses the instrumental of 'What Up' from {{< wiki-link "September 2004" >}}.
- 'Old MacDonald', ‘Chuck E. Shuffle’ and ‘Go Santa Go’ appear on the Studio C DVDs but could not be played.
