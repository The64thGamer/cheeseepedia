## Trivia:

- This was the first Studio C show to feature the puppets as the on screen counter part for Helen, Munch, Jasper and Pasqually. Prior to this show the walkaround costumes were used.
- The background for the Studio C puppets is random paints thrown at a wall.
- The changes between Studio C and Existing shows is some intermissions being moved around and Chuck singing 'Cheese Pizza is Pure Delight' instead of Jasper.
- Duncan Brannan's voice for Chuck E. has gotten much lower and evolved into his 'Avenger Chuck' tone, and his New Jersey accent is now minimal-sounding.
- This was the last original showtape before the release of the *Galaxy 5000* movie.
- Chuck E. sings 'Cheese Pizza is Pure Delight' in the Studio C version while Jasper sings it in the Existing Stages version.
