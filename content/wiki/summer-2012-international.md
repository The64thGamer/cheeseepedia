## Trivia:

'Summertime Groove', 'Fun, Fun, Fun' and 'Good Old Summertime' are originally from {{< wiki-link "Summertime 2000" >}}, 'In My Pool' 'Goin' On a Picnic' and "Barbecue" are originally from {{< wiki-link "Summertime 2003" >}}, 'SPF' and 'Summertime' is originally from '{{< wiki-link "Summer 2007 Show" >}}
The only difference between {{< wiki-link "Summer 2012" >}} and Summer 2012 (International) is the 'My Little Pony' intermission was replaced with Amphicar and 'Pound Puppies' was replaced with Closing Time?
