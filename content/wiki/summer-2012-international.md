## Trivia:

- The Ballgame is originally from {{< wiki-link "Spring Break" >}}, 'Summertime Groove', 'Fun, Fun, Fun', 'Good Old Summertime', and Wildlife are originally from {{< wiki-link "Summertime 2000" >}}, Baking With Betty - 'Trail Mix' is originally from the {{< wiki-link "January 2001 Show" >}}, Pizza Survivor is originally from the {{< wiki-link "September 2002 Show" >}}, 'In My Pool' 'Going on a Picnic' and "Barbeque" are originally from {{< wiki-link "Summertime 2003" >}}, and 'SPF' and 'Summertime' are originally from the {{< wiki-link "Summer 2007 Show" >}}.
- 'Firehouse' was originally used in the {{< wiki-link "January 2005 Show" >}}. The music was changed to be the same song used for the Birthday Break before {{< wiki-link "Birthday Star '95" >}}.
- The only difference between {{< wiki-link "Summer 2012" >}} and Summer 2012 (International) is that 'My Little Pony' was replaced with Amphicar from {{< wiki-link "September 2001 Show" >}} and 'Pound Puppies' was replaced with Closing Time? from {{< wiki-link "September 2000 Show" >}}. The version of these intermissions included on this show seems to be from the ChuckECheeseTV YouTube Channel, as the end card used on those uploads is present in both intermissions.
