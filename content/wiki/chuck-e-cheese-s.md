On a question on if the Nanuet animatronic would be worked on to finally be compatible with {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} shows, Mark would sidestep the answer to instead say that CEC had 'something cool planned' for the store. He would finally state that Nanuet being chosen does not have any affect on what future stores may also be chosen.<sup>(10)</sup> Kupferman would also later clarify that Nanuet was chosen after the survey results were submitted. He would then go on to express that Corporate is listening to the fans, however 'other considerations' are involved.<sup>(11)</sup>

- On the 23rd, David McKillips would announce that Mark Kupferman was visiting the {{< wiki-link "Charlotte, NC (7701 Pineville-Matthews Rd)" >}} location to make final decisions on their next remodel, implying it may get the same hybrid-store treatment as Northridge and Nanuet. This would be one of the highest voted shows in the {{< wiki-link "2024 CEC Future Planning Survey">}}.<sup>(13)</sup>
- On the 24th, CEC would announce that it would be saving three more animatronic locations, being Charlotte Pineville-Matthews with a Concept Unification Stage, {{< wiki-link "Hicksville, NY (Delco Plaza 11-15 Hanover Place)" >}} with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Springfield, IL (2369 McArthur Ave)" >}} with a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification 1-Stage" >}}.<sup>(14)</sup> Mark Kupferman would later remark that this was the last stages the company would be keeping the animatronics in based on the highest voted locations in the 2024 CEC Future Planning Survey.<sup>(15)</sup> The CEC Pop-Up Shop for employees would also open, featuring four new items. The shop would be planned to run until June 9th.

- On the 11th, CEC would make a post to its stores confirming that the Nanuet, NY location would be a '100% retro store', which would include 'retro nights'. The retro nights wouldn't be explained, but said they would focus around the early 2000's era of CEC.<sup>(5)(5)</sup>
- On the 12th, CEC would announce the Ninja Run, being a test addon to the Trampoline Zone. The announced test store would be {{< wiki-link "Grand Prairie, TX (2760 W I-20)" >}}, but the {{< wiki-link "Medford, OR (293 E Barnett Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Buffalo, NY (2638 Delaware Ave)" >}} and an unnamed Colorado location would also be rumored to receive it.<sup>(5)(20)</sup>
- On the 16th, the first Ninja Run would be confirmed to open at the Grand Prairie, TX store.<sup>(21)</sup>
- On the 18th, a {{< wiki-link "Looney Bird (Animatronic)" "Pizzacam" >}} animatronic was sent to the Charlotte Pineville-Matthews location from the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Distribution Center (Topeka, KS)" >}} for installation. This animatronic was previously from the {{< wiki-link "Laurel, MD (936 Fairlawn Ave)" >}} store and had been sitting in the warehouse for 2 years and 10 days.<sup>(5)</sup>

- On June 29th, Mark Kupferman would clarify that Nanuet, NY was not meant to be interpreted as a 'retro store' from a prior newsletter, but rather just a 'bonus location' to the {{< wiki-link "CEC Legacy Locations" >}}. Its 'retro nights' and additional artwork was not intended to have expectations of its {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} stage being upgraded to a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} or that programming would be brought back for the store, but simply additions to make the store unique and interesting.<sup>(25)(26)(27)</sup>
