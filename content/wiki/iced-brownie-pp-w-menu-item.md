The ***Iced Brownie*** was a {{< wiki-link "Pasqually's Pizza & Wings" >}} menu item introduced in 2020.
It consisted of a fudge brownie with icing drizzled on the top.

## History

The Iced Brownie was first added as part of a menu overhaul on July 8, 2020.<sup>(1)(2)</sup> The item was later rebranded "Oreo Iced Brownie", though no changes are apparent in the menu picture or description besides the mention of {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo" "Oreos" >}}. (This alteration happened no later than March 2021, though the file name of the menu image suggests it was likely added that January.)<sup>(3)</sup>
While there is no concrete source for when the item was removed from the menu, the {{< wiki-link "Brookie (PP&W Menu Item)" "Brookie" >}} was introduced on November 18, 2021<sup>(4)</sup> and appears to have effectively replaced the Iced Brownie. A {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" "Wayback Machine" >}} archive of the menu page suggests that the menu was updated on or around the end of that month, providing a potential timeframe for the item's removal.<sup>(5)</sup> At any rate, harder evidence suggests that the Iced Brownie was replaced by March 28, 2022 at the absolute latest.<sup>(6)</sup>
