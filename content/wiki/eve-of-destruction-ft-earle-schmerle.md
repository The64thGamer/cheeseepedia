***Eve of Destruction ft. Earle Schmerle* is a single segment showtape produced for the *[Creative Engineering YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjhqAaWA7JZtxm3Mof3KJcA).*
The song was of *Earl Schmerle* singing *Eve of Destruction* in front of a green screen, with war and other
political footage behind him. The video would be taken down by YouTube, and its subtitled release privated by
*Creative Engineering* themselves.**

## Controversy

While the original song release in 1965 was deemed controversial, and even banned in some parts of the
U.S.<sup>(1)</sup>, *Creative Engineering*'s version featured changed and updated lyrics to reflect the current
political climate of the time. The video did not go well with viewers of the *Creative Engineering* channel, even
with their output of more adult shows at the time. Notably, the sole singer of the song *Earl Schmerle*, recites a
slur towards the end of the song. After being privated, the original video would be removed in 2020 for violating
YouTube's policy on hate speech.
*Creative Engineering* did not mention the song in the future. The company has released multiple digital showtapes
from the early 2010's to fans with *Rock-afire Explosion* animatronics, though have not given any release Eve of
Destruction. Despite the controversy of the slur staying with the company to the present day, the company has continued
to use it as recent as October 2020 in the comment sections of videos.

### Unlisting

On December 18, 2022, the Creative Engineering YouTube Channel would have their session token stolen from a fraudulent
email and used to take over their channel to the prevalent at the time 'Tesla Live' crypto scam. A result of this hack
was the unlisting of all of the channel's privated videos, which would include the still up subtitled release of Eve of
Destruction. The video would stay unlisted until December 25th, where Creative Engineering would have their channel
control restored.<sup>(2)</sup> Alongside this listing, previous lost comments made by Creative Engineering about the
controversy when the video was originally uploaded were unearthed.<sup>(3)</sup>
