***Maynard*** is the Elf that plays the bass and thinks sometimes he is a one-elf band.

## History

Maynard was first installed in 1977 in Santa's Village (Jefferson, New Hampshire) by creative engineering for the first full show that they developed, where he operated until sometime in the 2010s. In 2006, the animatronics were replaced by ones created by Advanced Animations, but the showtape didn't change..

## Design

He is Elf with a goatee and some sunglasses; he wore a festive outfit with a Santa hat and was also holding a bass instrument.
