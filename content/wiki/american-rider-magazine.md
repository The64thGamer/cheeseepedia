The **American Rider (Magazine)** was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.

## Design

The poster is held in either a 20½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue - Biker (shelf item) which has Chuck E. Cheese wearing a black derby, Black leather jack, white gloves, jeans, and black shoes. In the background behind the statue is his black motorcycle.
