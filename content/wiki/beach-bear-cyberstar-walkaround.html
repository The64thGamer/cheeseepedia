The <b><i>Beach Bear Cyberstar Walkaround</b></i> was a walkaround used exclusively for <i>Cyberstar</i> videos at the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}.
The walkaround was produced by J&M Costumers, alongside the other costumes used in the Cyberstar videos.<sup>(1)</sup>

<h2> Variants </h2> There was only one version a Beach Bear Walkaround. The way you would be able to see out of the costume was possibly through the eyes. In some pictures and videos, Beach Bear is seen wearing a wig, while in others he is not. The wig appears to be detachable. Additionally, it seems that he does not have visible ears. He has also been seen wearing different shorts in some videos.
