This plush has the same beak and eyes with the 1994 CYRK, Inc Helen. The plushies hair is three fuzzy yellow balls placed along the head. Two green ribbons are placed along the pieces of hair on the left and right.  The plush is wearing a green cheerleading outfit with two yellow ribbons covering it. The plushies skirt uses the same green material with a yellow triangular pattern. The plushies shoes are very simple, being fully green with yellow shoelaces. Its tag reads as **'Chuck E. Cheese's** © 1996 ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc. Made in China'. The back reads as ALL NEW MATERIAL Contents: Polyester Fiber ОН 17389 РА 5081 MA 1340 ME 3658 Dennis Foland, Inc. San Jose, CA'.
