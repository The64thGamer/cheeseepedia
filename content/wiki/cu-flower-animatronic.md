The ***Concept Unification Flower*** was an animatronic figure that was only on the early 3-Stages in Texas. It lasted from 1989 to sometime in the mid-90's.

Its only movement was its mouth and it used the 'Dook Left Ear' bit as its signal, as this was an unused movement for the 3-Stage. The last showtape to program the flowers was the August 1996 show.
