***Pumpkin Festival Jasper* is a retrofit of {{< wiki-link "Jasper T Jowls (Cyberamic)" >}} at *Burger Farm & Garden Center* in Cincinnati, Ohio. (7849 Main St. (RT 32), Cincinnati, OH 45244)
The bot can only be seen when the location has its annual Fall Pumpkin Festival, in which it and other *Pizza Time Theatre* retrofits will be displayed as props for decoration from the last week of September through the end of October. None of them are hooked up in any way to be movable, with all cylinders and air hoses removed.
Jasper is displayed in a room with Chuck and Pasqually, often trading positions each year. They are decorated with wheat stalks, pumpkins, gourds, rags, a vase, and sit on haybales. Each have a general farmer theme to their outfits, complimenting the decorations.**

## Design

Jasper is similar to how he appeared at a *Pizza Time Theatre.* As for the outfit, Jasper now wears a large red hat, an exact copy of Chuck's retrofitted hat, with the shirt being replaced with a plaid design featuring mostly white, blue and red. A new handkerchief was added at the bottom of his mask. The banjos neck has since snapped from the head of banjo now resting within jaspers fingers and barely the head of the banjo as its only support.
