The ***Star Cast Member of the Month 2019 Pin* was given to CEC employees for their contributions in the store, to be worn on their lanyard.**

## Design

The design is a metal circular pin, gold in color. On the front is a printed design of the standard *Rockstar era* Star Cast Member pin, ditching the full custom shape and painting from previous years. The text on the pin says:
`2019 STAR CAST MEMBER OF THE MONTH`

## Acquirement

Employees could receive this pin by being the most outstanding cast member out of all employees for the month. Similar to the standard 'Employee of the Month' rewards given at other businesses. This reward was at the manager's discretion and could even not be given out for the month.
