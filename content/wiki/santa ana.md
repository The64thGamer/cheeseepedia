***Santa Ana, CA*** was an unopened Pizza Time Theatre that was advertised throughout 1979.

## History

On July 1st, 1979, Pizza Time Theatre would mention multiple planned stores, including Santa Ana, as "Other areas where we're negotiating space." On July 7th, an ad would appear for an electrical technician for both the Huntington Beach and the Santa Ana location.{{< cite 1 >}} It would note both are "under construction", and given the timeline for Huntington Beach, possibly was in planning around the beginning of the year and set to open in the later half.

An undated Pizza Time Theatre post card from 1979 would also note multiple planned and upcoming locations, mentioning Santa Ana. The card would have an offer only valid for the {{< wiki-link "Stockton, CA (4555 N Pershing Ave)" >}} location which opened in October of 1979, and was valid through November 30th of that year. This meant Santa Ana was still in its development stages by at least October.

A Santa Ana 1979 token was also in production with at least six known to exist, being the {{< wiki-link "PTT Token 134 (B)" >}}.{{< cite 2 >}}
