<b><i>20700 S Avalon Blvd</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in 1983 (month and date unknown) with a Balcony Stage and closed and relocated to the current location on January 5, 2014 with a 2-Stage.
The new location opened on January 16, 2014 with a bot-less Circles of Light, and is still open today.
Both locations are located in the SouthBay Pavilion Mall, which originally opened as Carson Mall in 1973, 10 years before the PTT opened.
<h2> History </h2>
Carson's Pizza Time Theatre opened in 1983 (month and date unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}, with unknown cabaret and lounge acts. Unfortunately, information on Carson's time as a PTT is very scarce. In 1989/1990, they received the 1986 SPT Remodel Program|1988 remodel, refurbishing every corner of the store, renaming the restaurant to 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza', and retrofitted the Balcony Stage to {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. Carson would be generally untouched until 1995/1996, when they received the 1990s Major Remodel|1993 remodel, as well as {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}. This involved removing older decor for new decor, changing the counters, removed most of the checkers around the store, changed the exterior to read 'Chuck E. Cheese's', and removed Chuck E.'s House Facade for the 2-Stage. Later on, they would receive Phase 2, changing little and removed the ball pit for {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}. In 2006/2007, they received their final remodel, the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, which involved majorly renovating the exterior, removing all '90s decor, tearing down the showroom walls as well as the balcony seating, removed the dim lighting, and likely expanded the restaurant. On January 5, 2014, Carson relocated a few stores down to the former Old Navy, effectively ending its 30/31 year history. The building would remain vacant for a short amount of time until it became part of a Cinemark theatre. As of June 2023, Cinemark remains on the space. The new store opened on January 16. That store still remains operational.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Carson at first had a Balcony Stage. Not much is known about it, and it was replaced with the C-Stage in 1989/1990. The C-Stage was then replaced with the 2-Stage in 1995/1996. The 2-Stage remained up until the January 2014 closure. The new store's stage was a bot-less Circles of Light, and the stage is still operational.
