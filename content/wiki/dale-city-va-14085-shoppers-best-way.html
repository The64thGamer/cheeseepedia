<b><i>14085 Shoppers Best Way, Store #71</b></i> is a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza</i>/<i>Chuck E. Cheese</i> location located in Dale City, Virginia; in the Smoketown Stations Shopping Center. The location opened February 15, 1993, with a 2-Stage, which is still open to this day.
This location received the 2.0 remodel in 2018 because of an exterior fire.
<h2> History </h2>
Dale City opened on February 15th, 1993, with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. The store would be remodeled a few times, until March of 2018, when there was a fire outside the building that damaged the building, forcing them to receive the 2.0 remodel. As of March 2023, the store still has the 2.0 remodel.
<h2> Stages </h2>
The store opened with a 2-Stage. They kept their 2-Stage up until March 2018 when an exterior fire damaged the store badly which made them start their 2.0 remodel which lasted roughly 7 months. The 2.0 remodel added the Pizzeria and Games logo, Play Pass machines, removal of {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} and stage, and a nicer interior. Dale City was the last Cyberamic store in northern Virginia and the third to last in the state; this was also the last 2-Stage in Virginia that didn't come from a closed store. The final MMBB stage in Virginia was {{< wiki-link "Chesapeake, VA (1528 Sam's Circle)" >}} which used animatronics from the {{< wiki-link "Merced, CA (721 W Olive Ave)" >}} location that closed in 1995.
