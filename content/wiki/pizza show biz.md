***Pizza Show Biz*** was an internal division of Topeka Inn Management, Inc. that was built some time during or after June of 1979 to manage a range of planned Pizza Time Theatre franchize locations, before being reworked in December of 1979 to form the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} divison.

## History

Throughout Pizza Time Theatre's early expansion in 1979, which by this point had 3 locations opened and plans for 12 by the end of the year, the company would begin talks with Topeka Inn Management to develop more Pizza Time Theatres as its first franchize partner. {{< cite 1 >}} 

The companies would reach an agreement in June of 1979, allowing TIM exclusive franchizing of Pizza Time Theatres in 16 states, that being Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. PTT and TIM would be co-developing these locations under the agreement. The contract would target 285 stores, with 85 for sub-franchizing. The agreement would set to cost TIM $200,000,000 to develop. {{< cite 3 >}}

At some point after the agreement, the Pizza Show Biz division of TIM would be founded, being fully staffed for the management of the restaurants, alongside sub-franchizing arrangements for interested parties. On November 5th, 1979, Pizza Show Biz would get its own offices at {{< wiki-link "Topeka, KS (2209 W. 29th Street)" >}}.{{< cite 2 >}}
