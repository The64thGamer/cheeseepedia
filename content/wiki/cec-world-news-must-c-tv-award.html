The <b>'CEC World News' (Must C TV Award)</b> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese in 1998.
<h2> Design </h2>
This poster features Chuck E. Cheese in news station hosts outfit wearing a office tuxedo. on the left side of the poster is Mr. Munch as a anchor reporting a story from the White House. On the bottom left corner is Jasper as a camera operator just like he was in the 'Name That Cheese' art.
<h2> Size/Dimensions </h2>
Like the other 'Must C TV' posters, this was made larger than actual TV posters, so it'd be cheaper and easier to retrofit the Phase 2 'record posters' with them.
<h2> Reception </h2>
The poster originally received generally positive reception upon release, however, as time passed, it began to get a more negative reception, with many critics of the Original Phase Trilogy using this as a literal poster child for showing how dated pre-2005 Chuck E. Cheese's stores are. Nowadays, it does have a cult following, either due to how absurd the poster is, or due to the 90s nostalgia boom.
