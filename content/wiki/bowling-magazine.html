The <b><i>Bowling Digest</b></i> <b><i>(Magazine)</b></i> was a poster created for Chuck E. Cheese's around 1994-1995 for the 1990s Major Remodel.
<h2>Design</h2>
The poster is held in either a 20Â½' x 17', or 15' x 12' dark blue/red picture frame. The main photo of the poster depicts the Chuck Statue- Bowling (Shelf Item) which has Chuck E. wearing a Bowling uniform while holding a bowling ball and alongside a set of miniature bowling pins.
