<b><i>Pensacola, FL (7350 Plantation Rd)</b></i> was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on December 6, 1981 with a Rock-Afire Explosion.
<h2> Stages </h2>
Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until September 1991, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters.
Between 1995 and 1999, Pensacola received the rare custom cheerleader Helen outfit.
By 2004, Chuck, Munch, and Helen’s latex masks had been replaced with the newer plastic masks. That same year, Jasper and Pasqually’s latex masks were also replaced with plastic. Helen’s cheerleader outfit had also been removed by that point, however the yellow pigtails were kept.
In either late 2007 or early 2008, Chuck’s tuxedo and derby was replaced with the full avenger outfit. At this time Helen’s yellow pigtails were also changed back to the standard black and white ones.
In April 2012, fan and show owner Snapper Ard completely revamped the show with new repairs, adjustments and customizations such as Jasper's red guitar (previously on his RAE show), orange tune machine pipes, and a name patch on Helen's shirt. The remaining prop characters (which consisted of Moon, Building, and Pizzacam) were also removed. Shortly after, Corp forced him to remove this customizations. All that was left afterward was Jasper's guitar, which was there until the remodel in 2018.
In July 2018, they received a dance floor along with the 2.0 remodel.
Around May 2023, the existing dance floor was replaced with a brand-new recessed model. A large video wall was also added along with new character posters.
<h2> History </h2>
This store opened as a franchised ShowBiz Pizza Place owned by Wellington Development of Florida on December 6, 1981. Then on August 31, 1987, Pensacola was bought back by corporate.
In August of 1991, Pensacola received their first remodel, with white walls, checkers, a relocated ordering counter, and showroom walls with -then-new for ShowBiz- windows.
Pensacola received their second remodel in 1995, obtaining record posters, rainbow lights, and a large sky crawl system.
Sometime between 1999 and 2004, Pensacola’s showroom walls were removed. Following this, their balcony seating was also removed sometime between 2004 and 2007.
In 2012 for unknown reasons the store did a minor remodel. The wall next to the salad bar and the speaker walls next to the stage were painted purple; the showroom shelves and lamps were also removed as well as the plants along the showroom walls.
As of 2016, they had Pizzacam's mech in parts above the walk-in cooler.
On July 31, 2017, the following posters were randomly removed as per request of DM: 1993 Saloon poster, 1991 Jasper, Helen, Chuck, and Pasqually postcards, various magazines, 1994 baseball bat and 3D baseball, 1994 hockey stick and hockey puck, Toddler Zone firetruck poster, 1994 small green and red stars, and 1994 Coach Chuck wall sign. These posters were distributed amongst cast members and some were given to a fan.
This store's 2.0 remodel process started the week of July 12, 2018 and was completed in mid August 2018.
