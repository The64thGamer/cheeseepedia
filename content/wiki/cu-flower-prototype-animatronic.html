The <b>CU Flower Prototype</b> was an animatronic figure that was used on the Concept Unification Prototype Stage. It presumably had a mouth movement and no others, like all other versions of the Flower character.
It seems like one or two sets were made, as there is the set from the CU Prototype Stage but also a photo of these flowers from a 'Surprises' test at the {{< wiki-link "Arlington, TX (2216 S Fielder Rd)" >}}. This may be potentially be the same set, but may not be as the basket has a different pattern and the leaves are different. It is impossible as of right now to work out if these are the same set.
