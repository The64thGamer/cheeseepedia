Fingers Dan was created for the {{< wiki-link "Bear Country Jubilee" >}} which was sold to Morey's Piers and Americana Amusement Park.

## History

Fingers Dan along with the Bear Country Jubilee show was developed from 1977 - 1978. One show would be sold to Americana Amusement Park in Monroe, Ohio. The current whereabouts of the show is unknown. A 2nd show was sold to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey. This show was sold back to CEI in 1984<sup>(1)</sup> and currently resides at the CEI museum.

## Design

In his design at Americana Amusement Park, he wore a black bowler hat with a green stripe near the brim. At Morey's Piers, he wore a straw hat with red and yellow feathers in it. He's a gray bear that plays a blue upright piano with a prop bear on top.

## Movements

Due to lack of footage or photos of internals, movements can only be inferred. All that is known is that he along with the rest of the bots in the show had very limited movement.
