***5089 E Florence Ave, Store #446*** was a Chuck E. Cheese's *Pizza Time Theatre*/*Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened sometime in 1982 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage, which is still open to this day. It is located in the Bell Shopping Center.

## History

Bell opened sometime in 1982. Unfortunately, there is hardly any information when it was a PTT, but we do know they had a Balcony Stage. Bell had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80's when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Balcony Stage for the C-Stage and added the early 90's decor. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the 2-Stage and removed the early 90's decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the 2005 remodel between 2007-2008 when they removed the Showroom walls and Balcony seating. Sometime in 2021, after sustaining a flood from a storm, they received the 2.0 carpet. Currently, as of January 2023, they still have the 2-Stage and 2005 remodel. In the summer of 2023, the stage would be stuck in random mode, possibly due to the Navori system being installed correctly. In October 2023, the stage would be removed for the 2.0 remodel.

## Stages

Bell opened with the Balcony Stage in 1982. Fortunately, there are a lot of photos and videos to exist of Bell. Unfortunately, however, they do not start filming until they are inside. So, the original exterior of Bell as a PTT is lost.
