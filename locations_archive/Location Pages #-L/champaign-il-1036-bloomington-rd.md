***1036 Bloomington Rd*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre* that opened in 1984 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed in December 1990 as a *ShowBiz Pizza* with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}.

## History

Champaign opened in 1984 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. However, almost nothing is known about the store at all. The store would get the 1988 remodel and {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} in 1989, and rename the store to ShowBiz Pizza in progress. The store closed in December 1990 for unknown reasons. The store would become many businesses, but today, it remains a 'Bargain Bins' discount store. The building itself still has some remains of when it used to be open- one of the colored checkers can still be seen on the wall under another layer of plaster, and the 'Now Showing' box remains to this day, although boarded up.

## Stages and Animatronics

The {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} was kept up until 1989, when they retrofitted it to {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. The stage would only last a year, as they would close in December 1990.
