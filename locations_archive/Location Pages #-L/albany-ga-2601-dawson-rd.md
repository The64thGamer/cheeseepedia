## History

Albany opened on December 16, 2003 with the Phase 3 remodel and a Small-Town Studio C|Studio C Cappa. Unfortunately, there isn't much info on Albany from around this time. In 2010, Albany received the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative|2003 remodel initiative, removing the dim lighting, added purple walls, added newer decor, and added checkers around the logo around the exterior. Albany would remain like this until July 2023, when Albany received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Small-Town Studio C|Studio C Cappa for a 2021 Model {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}. This remodel would make Georgia bot-less. As of late 2023, the remodel has been completed.
