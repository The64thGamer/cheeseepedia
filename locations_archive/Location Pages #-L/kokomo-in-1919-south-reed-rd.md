***1919 South Reed Rd, Store #341*** is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on April 6, 2004 and is still open today with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}.

## Stage

Kokomo opened with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}, one of four installed in Indiana. Not much is known about the stage, but in 2013, the cap was removed and in 2022, the bot stopped receiving programming.

## History

Kokomo opened on April 6, 2004 with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} game package and a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}. It is located across from the Kokomo Town Center. However, barely any documentation exists on this store online due to lack of documentation. In 2007/2008, Kokomo received bits of the 2005 update to the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, which removed dim lighting, expanded the location to the left, and added 05 decor. Further bits of Phase 3 were removed soon after, most recently the wall planters, as well as the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} by 2018/2019. As of October 2023, Kokomo remains open to this day.
