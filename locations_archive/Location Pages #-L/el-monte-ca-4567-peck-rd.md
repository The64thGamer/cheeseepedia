## History

### Pizza Time Theatre

Unfortunately, there is no documentation as a Pizza Time Theatre. But they did have a Balcony Stage.

### Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Remodel

It happened around the Late 80's, when they removed the Balcony Stage for the C-Stage and added some decor and games. In the Mid 90's, the C-Stage was removed for the 2-Stage.

### 'Phase 3' Remodel.

It happened around the Late 90's when they removed old decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until their closure in June 2020. In 2022, it became a Dollar Tree.
