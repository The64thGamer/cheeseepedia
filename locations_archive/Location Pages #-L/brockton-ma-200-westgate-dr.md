## History

### CEC (Spring 1993-April 2003)

Brockton opened in Spring 1993 (Date Unknown) in the Westgate Mall (Brockton) with a 2-Stage (One of five in Massachusetts). They would be one of the last locations to open with the 1988 Remodel as locations opening after it would receive the SPT 1992 Remodel. The store would receive it's one and only {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} in the Mid 1990's with the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as the the blue &amp; white awnings, checkers around the store, &amp; neon lights. This also changed the logo on the exterior and replacing the small red awnings with larger Red and Yellow ones. The store would then permanently close sometime in April 2003 (Day unknown) after 9-10 years of operation.

Best Buy would remain open until February 27th, 2021 when it would be permanently closed. in Mid May 2021, the store would be reopened as Best Buy outlet. As of March 2023, the space is still Best Buy Outlet.
