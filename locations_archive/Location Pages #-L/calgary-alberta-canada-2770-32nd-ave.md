They opened with the 1988 remodel like most stores at the time. The store would remain this way until around 1994-1995 when they would receive {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} (Which involved the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as The Blue &amp; White Awnings, checkers around the store, neon lights, &amp; Chuck E.'s House being replaced with a used Road Stage from the {{< wiki-link "Calgary, Alberta, Canada (9627 Macleod Trail)" >}} location which closed in 1994).

## Trivia

- Calgary 32nd Ave was the only CEC to ever get a used Road Stage from a closed location as it was Franchised at the time, they received it and most Road Stages that were being removed were either removed altogether or converted into a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} or a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. This is also the only case of this ever happening.
