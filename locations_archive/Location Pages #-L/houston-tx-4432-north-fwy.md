***Houston, TX (4432 North Fwy), Store #790***, also referred to as ***Northline***, is a *Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened in November 2009 with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} stage.

## Stage

When the store first opened, it featured a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} stage with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}. The bot would have its cap removed around September 2013. It also had its left ear torn off sometime around Summer 2021, being repaired weeks later. The bolts of the bot's head also broke sometime in March 2022, causing the bot's head to spin around continuously during its head movements, which would later be fixed months later. The show would go into Random Movements mode in September 2022 as a result of the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese Halloween Boo-Tacular 2022 Show" >}}, which used the {{< wiki-link "Navori System" >}} that resulted in excluding programming signals for Studio C stages. The stage would eventually be removed in February 2023 in favor of the store receiving the 2.0 remodel.

## History

With the decline of the Northline Mall, plans emerged in 2005 to redevelop in the mall into an open air shopping center with multiple anchors, which began construction in 2007 with demolition of the original mall. CEC Entertainment would then apply to the plaza redevelopment in 2009, beginning construction later that same year. The store would then open its doors on November 27th, 2009, coincidentally on the same day when its shopping center hosted an event of meeting Santa Claus.(1) During its operation, the shopping center would also host Halloween costume contests every year at this store. The {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} would be removed around mid-June 2017. Sometime around mid-April 2018, nearly the entirety of the store's walls would be repainted to the 2015 CEC Remodel Program|2015 Remodel's color scheme. This would be the store's last major remodel besides some additional game packages before receiving the 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel. Around mid-February 2023, the store would begin its 2017 2.0 Remodel Program|2.0 Remodel, receiving the *Refresh* version as apart of the company spending $6.8 million to renovate all their Houston locations(2). This began with removing the posters and the store's stage; the store would later receive a Trampoline Zone in December 2023, alongside other stores in the Houston Area.
