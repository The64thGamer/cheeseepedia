***5000 Shelbyville Rd***, also known as ***Mall St. Matthews*** or ***St. Matthews*** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened in 1984 (day and month unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed on December 1st, 1991, with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. This store notably was one of few stores to open during 1984, as the company was closing stores that didn't do well, due to bankruptcy. This was the 2nd store in Louisville, opened after {{< wiki-link "Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy)" >}} in July 1982. This was also possibly the 3rd location in Kentucky overall.

## History

### Pre-PTT Era (1962-1984)

In 1962, when the mall first opened, the space was probably some shops, until 1984, when Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre took the space over.

### PTT Era (1984-1991)

In 1984, this store would host its grand opening celebration, as the second ever Pizza Time Theatre in Louisville. This location, when it opened, was incredibly popular, and was partially responsible for {{< wiki-link "Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy)" >}} losing much of its business in the following years. According to the store manager, this store would host over 100 birthday parties a week. This store was a standard Pizza Time Theatre, having most features any other would have, such as wood paneling around counters and salad bars, signage, arcade games, menu items, and the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. this store would notably also have no guest stars, as they were retired by the time the store opened. In around 1989, the store would undergo the 1986 SPT Remodel Program process, this store would then install a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} couple years later. On December 1st, 1991, this store would have its final day, and permanently close for good due to several violations during the restaurant's inspections. The people who ran the store rescheduled every birthday party at the store to be hosted at {{< wiki-link "Louisville, KY (5743 Preston Hwy)" >}}. This would make that store much more successful, until they would also close in late 1997. The store employees also gave directions to the other store.

### Post-PTT Era (1991-Present)

In the coming years of this store's closure, it would become many businesses, with it being gutted. The spot is roughly where Auntie Anne's and Bath &amp; Body Works are now.
