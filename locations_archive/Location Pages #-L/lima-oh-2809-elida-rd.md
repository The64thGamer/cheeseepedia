***Lima, OH (2809 Elida Rd), Store #3228*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* located in Lima, Ohio. This location opened as a franchise on May 11th, 2009, and was one of two planned franchises by Smiles Food and Fun of Lima LLC and Buckeye Entertainment(1).

## Stages

When the store opened, it housed a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} with a 16 movement bot wearing the 'Cool Chuck' outfit. This outfit (besides the red hat) was replaced in early 2013 with the 'Avenger' outfit. The hat also remained past Fall 2013 when all stores were ordered to remove them, though it was taken off for a short period in December 2013 before being put back on. Around this time, the bot stopped being aired up and the show system had frequent glitches. This was eventually fixed around Summer 2014. The bot continued to run as normal with a few movements out, though in October 2015 the teeth were removed from the bot. Shortly after, the bot's eyelashes were also missing. The bot stayed in this state throughout 2016. In 2017, the system starting glitching once again and the bot was not aired up. The bot was fixed later in the year and it ran throughout 2018, though the system glitches continued. Alongside the store being purchased by corporate in early 2019, the bot was replaced with a 32 movement from the Downingtown PA store. The show saw no more major changes until the store's closure in 2020. It should also be noted that this location was one of the last with the bluescreen camera.

## History

In April 2008, an application for a loan was commissioned(2) in order to open a Chuck E. Cheese in Lima Ohio. Smiles Food and Fun of Lima LLC and Buckeye Entertainment given a $475,000 loan to remodel the former carpet warehouse and buffet restaurant into the $2.1 million CEC location. The store was expected to open later that year, though it's opening would end up being May 11th 2009. The location was typical of stores opened at the time, featuring the 'Cool Chuck' Exterior and Interior and a Studio C Beta show. While being a franchise the store would receive a few new game packages in 2014, 2016 and 2017.

### Corporate Acquisition

The store was acquired by corporate in May 2019. The store would receive one more upgraded game package, as well as a Studio C bot from the closed Downingtown PA store and the Play-Pass system.

### Closure

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic all stores were required to only allow pick-up and delivery orders. This was until around May 2020 when the store was temporarily closed and stopped accepting any orders. Then in June 2020 CEC Entertainment filed for bankruptcy, causing Lima to close on June 23rd, 2020. The building still sits for lease, though some games were purchased by Westgate Entertainment Center (another FEC in Lima).
