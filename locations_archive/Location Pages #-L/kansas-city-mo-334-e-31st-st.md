334 E 31st St was the Rockafire Bar, a bar and arcade located in Kansas City, MO. The barcade opened on May 24th, 2018, and closed February 25th, 2019.

## The Stage

Rockafire Bar featured an unique stage. The stage was located in the northwest corner of the building and took the shape of an L. The stage featured all of the rockafire explosion characters except for Antioch, Sun, Moon, Choo-Choo, and Looney Bird. Props the stage featured were Rolfe's Applause sign, the RAE sign, some cutout trees, An 'Used and Abused Tars' sign (seen on the mini stage), and Billy Bob's gas pump (fitted with a color changing LED). Beach Bear had an unique look, as he featured a blue necklace and a white wig (which was later removed). The computer that ran the show sat on the desk directly behind Rolfe. Later between August and October 2018, a mural was painted on the walls behind the stage, which included all of the missing characters (except for antioch) and props.

## The Barcade

The arcade portion was an area that featured classic arcade cabinets and pinball machines. In January 2019 Cyberamic mechs from 'Boomis Pizza Fiesta' were installed on a shelf on the back wall of the arcade. The animatronics were only for display purposes as they were never ran for the public.
