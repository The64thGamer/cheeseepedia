***4444 Wisconsin Route 16, Store #724*** is a ShowBiz Pizza Place/Chuck E. Cheese which opened on December 15, 1982 as a corporate store with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day. This location received Concept Unification somewhere in 1991, then received the 2.0 remodel in June 2022.

## Stages

Originally, La Crosse featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-Afire Explosion into the 3-Stage. In June 2022, La Crosse would replace their 3-Stage with a Dance Floor and Video Wall, as part of their 2.0 remodel. It was the last 3-Stage in Wisconsin. As of March 2023, La Crosse still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.

## History

La Crosse opened on December 15th, 1982 as the fifth ShowBiz Pizza Place in Wisconsin, after Green Bay which opened nearly 2 months prior which is October 28th, Madison which opened 5 months prior which is July 7th &amp; Milwaukee (Good Hope Rd &amp; S 27th St, both opened a year prior in June 17th and August 27th, 1981, respectively) and as a corporate-owned store. La Crosse originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive the 1988 remodel, receiving Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, and removing all SPP decor for newer decor. In the mid-late 1990s, La Crosse received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights and some other decor, replaced the logo with Coach Chuck, and received SkyTubes. In 2006-2007, La Crosse received the 2005 Remodel removing older decor for newer decor, and removed the Showroom Walls. At some point in 2014, the entire plaza was rebuilt to accommodate the opening of the Dick's Sporting goods and La Crosse's exterior received the 2013 Update, as well as removing the portion of the entrance that was attached to movie theater where the Dick's Sporting Goods is currently. La Crosse would remain like this until June 2022, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the 3-Stage and replacing it with a [Dance Floor + Video Wall](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Live_Stage_%28Dance_Floor%29). Currently, as of March 2023, La Crosse still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall. Surprisingly, the road sign did not change, though the text is now white on a green background and now reads 'Chuck E. Cheese'.

## Trivia

- La Crosse was the 5th ShowBiz to open in Wisconsin after {{< wiki-link "Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd)" >}} (Opened June 17th, 1981), Milwaukee, WI (4595 S 27th St) (Opened August 27th, 1981), {{< wiki-link "Madison, WI (438 Grand Canyon Dr)" >}} (Opened July 7th, 1982), &amp; {{< wiki-link "Green Bay, WI (1273 Lombardi Access)" >}} (Opened October 28th, 1982).
- La Crosse was one of three ShowBiz locations in Wisconsin to undergo Concept Unification (The other two being {{< wiki-link "Madison, WI (438 Grand Canyon Dr)" >}} &amp; {{< wiki-link "Green Bay, WI (1273 Lombardi Access)" >}}) as Milwaukee, WI (7401 Good Hope Rd) replaced their Rock-afire with a [Rocker Stage](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/Cyberamics_Rocker_Stage) in June 1988 (Their show would get Concept Unification when the show was installed at [Raleigh](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_NC_%283501-131_Capital_Blvd%29)) and the store would eventually close sometime in 1995 with a [1-Stage](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/1-Stage). This also happened in {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)" >}} though they got a Road Stage around 1993/1994 and then a 1-Stage in 2015. Milwaukee, WI (4595 S 27th St) &amp; [Appleton](https://cheeseepedia.org/wiki/Appleton,_WI_%282424_W_College_Ave%29) on the other hand were closed by 1986 and never converted into Chuck E. Cheese.
- It was also the 130th ShowBiz location to open.
