***13101 Harbor Blvd, Store #422*** also known as ***Harbor*** is a *Pizza Time Theatre/Chuck E. Cheese* that opened in November 1981 (day unknown) as a franchised *Pizza Time Theatre* with a Balcony Stage Show. It is located in the Harbor Plaza Shopping Center. It should not be confused with the short lived Garden Grove, CA (11889 Valley View St) which opened around the same time (November 1981) and closed in 1984 with the Balcony Stage.

## History

Garden Grove (Harbor) opened its doors in November 1981 with a Balcony Stage. It was originally a franchised-owned Pizza Time Theatre location, being one of the few that survived PTT's bankruptcy and was bought on October 22, 1984, along with many other locations by the corporate. Like all locations at some point, Garden Grove received the 1988 remodel in 1989-1990 and removed older PTT decor for newer decor, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. In the Early 90's, Garden Grove received a major remodel adding newer decor, replacing older decor, and removal of the lounge. In the Late 90's, Garden Grove received Phase 2, removing older 90's decor for newer decor, removing the ball pit for SkyTubes, and the installation of the Toddler Zone. In 2011, Garden Grove received the 2010 Update to the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} removing all older decor for newer decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, relocation of the stage, and strangely, the removal of the Toddler Zone. This location remained like this until in August 2022, when they received the 2.0 remodel with a unique mural. Currently, as of October 2023, Garden Grove still has the 2.0 remodel with the Dance Floor and Video Wall.

## Stages

Sometime between 1989 and 1990, the location installed the short-lived {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. In the Early 90's, the C Stage was removed for the 2-Stage, with this being its last animatronic show. During their 2.0 remodel in August 2022, the 2-Stage was removed with everything destroyed during store hours. All Six of the Cyberamics were left out in the open near an exit in the showroom and trashed later that night.
