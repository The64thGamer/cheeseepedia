**CF8V+5V, Lusail, Qatar** is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in November 2022 with a Chuck E. Live Stage, which is still open to this day. This location is the very first CEC in the country of Qatar, which is in the Middle East. The franchisee of the Lusail store is Benchmark Hospitality Services.

## History

In December 2021, an article was published by PR Newswire with the title of 'Chuck E. Cheese Signs New Development Agreements in Qatar, Suriname and Guyana', with information about the Mall of Suriname, Suriname store, which opened in September 2022, and a future CEC in Guyana, and also included information about a store in Qatar, with the franchisee being Benchmark Hospitality Services(1). After more than a year of development, the CEC in Doha (Lusail), Qatar opened in November 2022, just in time for the [2022 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup), which may have contributed to its instant popularity with the families of Qatar, as well as it being close to Lusail Stadium, where the [2022 FIFA World Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_final) was held in December 2022.

## Stages

When the Lusail location first opened, they featured a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and Video Wall, with the Dance Floor being a 2021 Model. As of January 2023, they still have the Dance Floor and Video Wall.
