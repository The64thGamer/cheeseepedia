## Stage

Beaverton opened with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 32m stage. Around 2005, the curtains were disabled. In 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. By September 19, 2022, the bot was only programmed to random movements.

## History

Beaverton opened in January 2003 (day unknown) as a relocation of the *4445 SW 110th Ave* location. It originally had {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}}, which included some early 2000s decor, {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}, and a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 32m. In the late 2000s, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing most 90s decor for new decor, replaced the lighting, and added purple walls. The exterior only received minor changes. Around 2016/2017, the exterior was half-changed to the 2015 logo, but the letters stayed the same. They later received a lot of 2.0 artwork but did not receive the full remodel. On January 30, 2023, the store was bought by corporate. On July 16, 2024, the store would begin its {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, removing its stage on the same day, which is how the store stands to this day with its refresh.
