## Stages

## History

Laguna Hills opened in October 2001 (day unknown) with a Studio C Beta stage and {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} of the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program|1993 remodel. They also had a different exterior rather than the current one. In 2006/2007, Laguna Hills received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, which involved removing most 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls, replacing the dim lighting, and changing the exterior. In the early 2010s, the shopping center received an exterior refresh, changing the exterior once again, but the Avenger logo was kept. In Late 2023, Laguna Hills received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} and removed the Studio C Beta for a Dance Floor + Video Wall. As of January 2024, Laguna Hills remains operational to this day.
