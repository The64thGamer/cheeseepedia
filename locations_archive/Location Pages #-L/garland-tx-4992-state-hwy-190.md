***4992 State Hwy 190, Store #584*** is a *Chuck E. Cheese's* location running from November 15, 2006, to current day. This store is the relocation of {{< wiki-link "Richardson, TX (1235 E Belt Line Rd)" >}} which opened as a *ShowBiz Pizza Place* with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} and closed as a *Chuck E. Cheese's* with a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}} earlier in the month.

## Stages

When the store opened, they had a Studio C Beta, 16m which they still have to this day. When they opened, the store's {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}} had the Cool Chuck outfit with the Shirt, Khaki Shorts, and Red Cap. In around the Early-Mid 2010's, Garland replaced Chuck's outfit with the Avenger outfit. In 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. In the Mid 2010's, Chuck's Avenger shorts were replaced with the Rockstar Jeans. This the last of two Garland locations to have an animatronic show.

## History

The Garland TX location on State Hwy 190 opened on November 15th, 2006 as a relocation to the Richardson location 15 minutes away. They opened with a Studio C Beta, 16m &amp; the 2005 Remodel. In around 2014-2015, they remodeled to have an Open Kitchen alongside the {{< wiki-link "Dallas, TX (13364 Montfort Dr)" >}} location. In around 2017, they remodeled the exterior to a 2.0 Exterior (Without remodeling the interior). As of February 2023, Garland still has the 2005 Remodel, 2.0 Exterior, &amp; Studio C Beta 16m.

## Infamous Photo

A popular photo was taken of the restaurant that was used heavily in media to portray a generic CEC restaurant. Later on the 2013 logo would be edited onto the storefront to match the state of the brand at the time. The photo would begin to gain infamy on December 9, 2014, when the YouTube channel [Game Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w) posted their second Five Nights at Freddy's video theory, titled: *'Game Theory: FNAF 2, Gaming's Scariest Story SOLVED!'(1)*. In the video, the producer *Matthew Patrick* edited the Garland photo to portray it as *Freddy Fazbear's Pizza*. Five Nights at Freddy's portrayal at the time was heavily shared around as 'Chuck E. Cheese's characters haunting the building', before the widespread knowledge of FNaF's plot and concepts were known by the mainstream. Game Theory would continue to use the image to portray Freddy Fazbear's Pizza for all of his future theories, which would garner hundreds of millions of views across almost 60 videos. Widespread use of the image was also seen in the FNaF fandom, sometimes with younger audiences mistaking it for a real location. This would happen alongside a photoshopped photo of *Papa's Pizza Parlor* (1577 Coburg Rd, Eugene, OR 97401) around the same time, and was part of a general movement amongst young fans to call places named 'Freddy's' looking to find the series' characters in real life. Though the popularity of FNaF's murderous animatronics did change younger viewer's perception of the restaurants, and some places may have also been called by kids under similar pretenses of asking about killer robots, the specific Garland store was never identified by the fandom as the origin of the photo. Later on, the creator of Five Nights at Freddy's, *Scott Cawthon*, collaborated with *Sally Dark Rides* on a potential FNaF animatronic dark ride. The ride never came to fruition, but Sally published the concept onto their website for fans to see. One of the concept art images depicts the guests walking into a Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, which its outside had never been depicted officially at the time. The art was build specifically over the Garland photo, likely from its popularity as both a Chuck E. Cheese's reference photo, and its knowledge in the fandom at the time. This built the photos legacy even further, making the Five Nights at Freddy's edit just as infamous as the original depiction. The photo was also used in a lot of videos made with the animation website, GoAnimate. Now known as Vyond, mostly used in 'Caillou Gets Grounded'. Most of the time it is the edit with the 2013 logo.
