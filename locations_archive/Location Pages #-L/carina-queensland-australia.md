***1151 Creek Rd*** was a {{< wiki-link "Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse" >}} that opened in 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed between 1984 and 1986. This store was a relocation of the {{< wiki-link "Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}} location and would be the last location to open in Australia.

## Stage

Charlie Cheese's would have a standard {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and would have Cyberamic characters likely to have came from the {{< wiki-link "Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}}. Because of this it is well to say that this location kept the Madam Oink character until they received the Bandstand Show in-around 1984. It is also unknown if they've also relocated the Dolli Dimples Cyberamic to this new location.

## History

Little is known about this store as opposed to it's {{< wiki-link "Surfer's Paradise, Queensland, Australia" >}} other than the location closing due to Pizza Time Theatre's bankruptcy.
