## Trivia

- Before Franchised CECs were renumbered to four digit numbers in 2010, Fayetteville was ***Store #209*** according to the old chuckecheese.com website from 2009. It was renumbered to ***Store #3212*** when Corporate renumbered Franchised stores with four digit numbers. The store number is now the store number for the {{< wiki-link "Fargo, ND (1202 Nodak Dr)" >}} location after it was bought out by Corporate.
