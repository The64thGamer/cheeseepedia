## Trivia

- Birmingham was the fifth ShowBiz Pizza Place in Alabama
- Huntsville was one of seven ShowBiz locations in Alabama to be converted into Chuck E. Cheese. The other six are {{< wiki-link "Mobile, AL (710 Downtowner Loop)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Huntsville, AL (1220 Jordan Lane)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Montgomery, AL (2940 E South Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Birmingham, AL (9325 Parkway East)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle)" >}}, &amp; {{< wiki-link "Sheffield, AL (4700 Hatch Blvd)" >}}. The other three ShowBiz locations Tuscaloosa, AL (1335 McFarland Blvd)|Tuscaloosa, {{< wiki-link "Cullman, AL (210 2nd Ave)" >}}, &amp; {{< wiki-link "Midfield, AL (34 Phillips Dr)" >}} closed in December 1985 (Tuscaloosa), &amp; April 1986 (Cullman &amp; Midfield) respectively as they were the only three not to make it to Concept Unification. Midfield's show however ended up undergoing Concept Unification when it was installed at the {{< wiki-link "Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd)" >}} location
- This location is probably best well known for spawning the infamous 'Abandoned Chuck E. Cheese animatronic' image, which went viral in early 2021.
