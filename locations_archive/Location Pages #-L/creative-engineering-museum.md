The ***Creative Engineering Museum* is a planned museum in Florida that will host a variety of Creative Engineering animatronic shows.**

## History

During the moving of the {{< wiki-link "Orlando, FL (47 W Jefferson St)" >}} that started on June 20th, 2022, it was planned that all critical assets would be moved to the {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering Workshop" >}} first, while all animatronics planned for the museum would stay in the R&D building until a property for the museum could be decided on.
Eventually, an unknown location in *Siesta Key* would be located and decided on, though deals were not in place yet to begin moving characters, so work was still done on moving things to the workshop. On September 29th, 2022, the deal with the Siesta Key location would fall through, leaving no place to move the Museum characters before the lease was up on the R&D building. By November it was decided to move the museum characters to the workshop building until a building could be located.https://youtu.be/kAOFs_PN9Kk
Some time in 2023, a 'Plan B' building would be found at an unknown location. It is currently unknown if the deal for the location has gone through.<sup>(0)</sup>
