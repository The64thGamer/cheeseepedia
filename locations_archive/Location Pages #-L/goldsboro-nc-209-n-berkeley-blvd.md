### CEC (September 19, 2003-Present)

Goldsboro opened on September 19th, 2003, in the Ashley Plaza with a Small-Town Studio C , this was the first Studio C Cappa store to open in the state of North Carolina.

Around October 2013, the store would then receive the 2013 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved replacing the dim lighting with bright lighting, an exterior remodel, adding purple walls, and replacing store art. The store also received an expansion during this time, in which the neighboring tenant Shoe Show had relocated within the Plaza and the wall separating Chuck E. Cheese and Shoe Show was knocked down. Expanding the game room adding 30 player positions, as well as adding a tech room and birthday closet. The store's exterior was later repainted alongside the rest of plaza.
