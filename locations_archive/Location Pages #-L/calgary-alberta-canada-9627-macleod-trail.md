***9627 Macleod Trail*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza* that opened on August 31, 1991, with a Road Stage, which closed sometime in 1994.

## History

This place was originally Bullwinkle’s Family Food N’ Fun Restaurant that opened on May 18th, 1984; the restaurant had a Canadian Northwoods Lodge theme with a color palette of brown and blue on the inside, once Chuck E Cheese’s bought the building, they repainted it white with the 1988 Remodel; adding blue &amp; white awnings, neon lights, &amp; checkers around the store. The Chuck E. Cheese would open on August 31st, 1991, as C*huck E. Cheese's Pizza* with a Road Stage (One of two installed in Canada). Once the place closed in 1994, it was bought once more by a different company now the building still operates as Schank’s Sport and Grill, and one of the Bullwinkle animatronics that survived.

## Stages
