***3250 Chicagoland Circle, Store #678*** is a *Chuck E. Cheese* that opened on January 29th, 2007, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 16m. They received the 2.0 remodel in Early 2020. It is a freestanding building, unlike the previous location which was located next to a Kmart. This is not to be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Joliet, IL (1965 W Jefferson St)" >}} location which opened on July 13, 1983, with the {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} and closed in January 2007 with a {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}.

## History

Joliet opened on January 29th, 2007 in a freestanding building with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}, 16m with the 2005 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. This was one of six Betas installed in Illinois and was one of the three 16m Beta installations in the state (not counting the two Beta 16m 3-Stages in the state {The stage at this location would be converted into one of the two after 2.0}). When it opened, it opened with a 16m 3-screen Studio C Beta. The store wouldn't change much during the 2010s except for new games, the Blue-Screen camera (And later the Blue-Screen itself.), and the removal of the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}. In February 2020, the store received 2.0 and replaced the stage with a 2019 Model Dance Floor. This was a month before COVID-19. In March 2024, the store received the Trampoline Zone package. As of June 2024, Joliet still has 2.0 and the 2019 Dance Floor. As for the bot, it was sent to Darien to replace their 3-Stage bots but was destroyed when they got 2.0.
