## History

Independence opened in May 2012 (day unknown) as the relocation of the old store. It has the 2010 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which included multiple things, like {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} and the Beta itself. Much has changed as now the store is now a 2.0 store.
