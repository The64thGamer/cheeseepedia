## History

Hattiesburg opened on July 26, 1984, with a Rock-afire Explosion. This was confirmed to be the last ShowBiz Pizza to open in Mississippi. Unfortunately, information on Hattiesburg's SPP is extremely scarce. However, we recently found Hattiesburg's closing date, which was sometime in October 1986. It is unknown why they closed, but it may be that they have been underperforming. Multiple businesses have taken up the space, and as of now, it is a bar named 'Se√±or Frog Cantina'.
