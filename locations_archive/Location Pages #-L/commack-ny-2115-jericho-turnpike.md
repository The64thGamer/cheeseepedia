***2115 Jericho Turnpike, Store #504*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* located in Commack, New York. The location opened on January 23, 1995, and closed on June 14, 2015(1). This location should not be confused with Commack, NY (6137 Jericho Turnpike) which was a Pizza Time Theatre location that was open from 1983-1987.

## Stages

This location opened with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} show, which featured a turntable for Chuck E. In 2005, the showroom was relocated from the back left-hand corner of the restaurant to the right-hand side of the restaurant which can be seen upon entry. In the process, the existing stage was replaced with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}.

## History

The location's first major known renovation was in 2005, when the showroom was swapped with the game room and showroom walls were removed as a result. In 2013, the restaurant was also featured in local news for a brawl that erupted in the Kid Check area.(2) Upon its closure, the location was converted into a Bar Louie. In 2019, the Bar Louie ceased operations; the location is currently a funeral home.(3)
