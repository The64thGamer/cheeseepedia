***Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd, Building D-100)*** was the third *Pizza Time Theatre* location that opened sometime within the week of May 28th - June 3rd of 1979 with a Cyberamics Portrait Stage|Portrait Stage and two floors, which closed in January of 1994 with a Unknown Stage. It should not be confused with Concord, CA (1611 Willow Pass Rd), which opened on June 18th, 2009, with a Studio C Beta, 16m and is still operating to this day.
