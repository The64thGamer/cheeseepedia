## History

### 1982-2000

On January 6, 1983, Tom Gibb of *Altoona Mirror* confirmed that in late September 1982, Michael Phenix, president of Family Restaurant Concepts Inc, met the ShowBiz Pizza Place|ShowBiz Pizza press in Altoona and signed a lease with Pleasant Valley Shopping Center owner, PVSC Company. The location was originally going to open in February 1983, but never occurred due to the lease not being signed. At the time, there was an 80% chance of ShowBiz Pizza being in the location, and Altoona Enterprises and the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority agreed Family Restaurant Concepts Inc. to issue $1 million in tax-free, low-interest bonds to finance the project.(1) On March 2, 1983, it was confirmed that Family Restaurant Concepts Inc. proposed to build ShowBiz Pizza Place in the Pleasant Valley Shopping Center.(2) The original opening date was scheduled to be in October 1983, but was delayed by a month for unknown reasons.(3) The location opened on November 23, 1983, as the fifth ShowBiz Pizza Place in Pennsylvania.(4) The location performed really well, becoming a popular location with kids, as well as teenagers and adults.(5)(6) Billy Bob also made outside appearances in the Altoona area, such as the Logan Valley Mall Christmas Parade in 1985.(7) Evidence shown that in July 1987, due to ShowBiz Pizza's merge with Chuck E. Cheese's, the location would be renamed to Chuck E. Cheese's.(8) Around between September and October 1st, 1987, ShowBiz Pizza Place was officially renamed to Chuck E. Cheese's,(9)(10) though it presumably kept the ShowBiz Pizza Place sign until the early '90s. It received {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} sometime in 1991 (date unknown), replacing Rock-Afire Explosion with Munch's Make Believe Band. The {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} happened sometime after Concept Unification. Circa. 1996, the Scott Wilson latex mask of the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic was replaced by the Duncan Brannan latex mask. Sometime in the 2000s (officially unknown year: 2000), it became the first animatronic in which its latex mask was replaced by a plastic mask.

### 2001-2011

The location's entertainment package was updated to {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} in the early 2000s (officially unknown year: 2001), which included the installations of the Toddler Zone and the Ticket Muncher. Minor changes occurred after the upgrade. In circa. 2002, Mr. Munch's latex mask was replaced by a plastic mask. Between July 22, 2003, and December 11, 2006, the 'Pizza' logo besides the 'Chuck E. Cheese's' logo was removed at the exterior side of the building. Circa. late 2000s, the circular owning above the entrance door was replaced by a triangular owning. In 2010, the {{< wiki-link "Ticket Blaster" >}} was installed into the location.

### 2011-2024

In mid-2011, the location went through a {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, which included replacing older decor with newer decor, removing the Toddler Zone, applying purple paint to walls, and remodeling the exterior. The grand opening after the remodel initially included a white sign of the Open sign with the Avenger Chuck logo beside it. It was eventually replaced by the then-official Avenger Chuck logo. Sometime in 2011, Pasqually's latex mask was replaced by a plastic mask. Between 2011 and 2012, Helen and Jasper's latex masks were replaced by their plastic masks, and Pizzacam was removed. Prior to the changes, it was the last worldwide location to keep Helen's latex mask and the last US location to keep Jasper and Pasqually's latex masks. Munch Jr., Moon, and Building animatronics were later removed sometime after 2011. The Chuck E animatronic gets to keep the Cool Chuck clothes until being replaced by the Avenger Chuck clothes. Between October 2016 and May 2017, the Avenger Chuck shorts was replaced by Rockstar Chuck jeans. Between February and October 2012, the curtains on the stage were removed. After the 2011 remodel, the In Pizza We Trust wink was still there, until it was replaced by a Cyberamic wink sometime after that. Around 2016, the Concept Unification board on the TV beside Chuck E. got removed. Around late 2017, the Munch's Make Believe Band sign got moved to the former TV spot, and a TV was added on the middle of the 3 Stage above center stage, similar to {{< wiki-link "York, PA (2801 E Market St)" >}}. Around the late 2010s, the rolling disco ball got replaced with a plastic one. During COVID-19, the huge sidewalk at the exterior of the building was removed for parking, and the Skytubes were removed on October 13, 2020. Sometime in 2023, the stage was put into random movements due to CEC Entertainment not programming any new songs (though existing songs are still performed). The animatronics were turned back on in early 2024. The {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}} started on May 12, 2024, and a day later, the 3 Stage was removed. This would mean no more MMBB Animatronic Stages in Pennsylvania.

### 2024-present

Currently, as of August 2024, the location still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor. The grand reopening event of this location happened on August 6, 2024.(11)
