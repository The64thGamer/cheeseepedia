***5500 Grossmont Center Dr, Store #405*** is a *Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza* that opened on August 2, 1993 with a 1-Stage and closed on December 29, 2024.

This location was the last location that still says 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' on the building, and the second-to-last to have the text at all, with {{< wiki-link "Altoona, PA (3415 Pleasant Valley Blvd)" >}} having the logo on the sidewalk sign. This store is possibly a relocation of {{< wiki-link "El Cajon, CA (310 Fletcher Pkwy)" >}} *Pizza Time Theatre*, as it was only 10 minutes away from La Mesa's CEC. That store opened in May 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} and closed in 1993 (Possibly a few weeks or so before La Mesa's opening) with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} which was next to Kmart (The building was demolished for Home Depot sometime in 2004).

Cheese's Pizza' on the building, and the second-to-last to have the text at all, with {{< wiki-link "Altoona, PA (3415 Pleasant Valley Blvd)" >}} having the logo on the sidewalk sign. With the acquiring and future redevelopment of Grossmont Center (The mall the La Mesa CEC is a part of) by a real estate firm in 2021, the La Mesa store would close in December 2024.
