***3046 Hempstead Turnpike*** was a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened in January 1985 (day unknown) and closed in 1989 (month and day unknown) with a Balcony Stage. This location was the very first modern CEC location to open.

## Stages

Levittown opened with a Balcony Stage. Like most short lived CECs, info on this stage is very scarce, but they did not receive the Chuck E.'s House Facade upgrade, as they closed in 1989. This location had the 4th last Balcony ever installed, as CEC would take a break from opening stores in 1986.

## History

Levittown opened in January 1985 (day unknown) as the very first modern CEC store, as well as one of 3 locations to open in 1985. As always, they had a Balcony Stage. Sadly, information on Levittown's Chuck E. Cheese's is very scarce, so no videos or photos exist anywhere. It closed in 1989 (month and day unknown) for unknown reasons. It soon became many different businesses before the building was demolished in 2007 for Miller's Ale House. As of July 2023, Miller's Ale House is still on the space.
