***Guatemala City, Guatemala (Ave La Reforma 7-62, Zona 9)*** was a franchised *ShowBiz Pizza Place* that opened in 1986 and closing in 1996 a *Chuck E. Cheese's.* Prior to {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, the location was not officially acknowledged by {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} during its early years of operation. However, unlike other international ShowBiz stores, Guatemala City may have been the only location outside the United States to be converted into a Chuck E. Cheese's.

## History

This ShowBiz in particular had unique menu items, such as pizzamoffin, pizzpan, and pancakes.(1) Prior to its relocation it was remodeled to fit 1986 SPT Remodel Program|ShowBiz Pizza Time's current appearance. The location would relocate to {{< wiki-link "Guatemala City, Guatemala (Blvd LiberaciÃ³n 6-31, Zona 9)" >}} in 1996.

## Stages

This location's {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} show was originally from the Terre Haute, IN (3820 S US Hwy 41) location, which had just closed about year prior. The show more than likely received Concept Unification prior to 1996.
