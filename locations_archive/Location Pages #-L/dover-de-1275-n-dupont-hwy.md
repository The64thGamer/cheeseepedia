## History

Dover opened on December 27, 2002, as the last of 3 Small-Town Studio C Prototype stages and the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} remodel. Around 2005, the location received a minor remodel, removing the Small-Town Studio C Prototype stage for a Small-Town Studio C|Studio C Cappa stage. Between 2009 and 2011, the dim lighting was removed, and the exterior was replaced with a standard {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} exterior. The {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} were also removed somewhere presumably in 2019. In 2023, the store received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, removing the Cappa for a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} + {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}. As of October 2023, Dover remains like this.
