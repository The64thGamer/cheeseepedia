***Augusta, Maine* was a planned Chuck E Cheese's location that would have been opened sometime between 2003-2004 with an unknown stage<sup>(1)</sup>, likely a Studio C Cappa**

## History

On April 11th, 2003, an article by the Kennebec Journal was published. This article detailed several businesses planning to open in the Marketplace at Augusta, a shopping center in Augusta, Maine. Among the businesses listed were a Chuck E Cheese. Not much information was given about it, besides that it would be 7,150 square feet. Given the size, and by the stores opening at the time, it can be inferred this store likely was going to receive a Studio C Cappa.
Not much is known about the location past this, however, due to this being the only mention of the store, it is assumed that the location ended up being cancelled.
