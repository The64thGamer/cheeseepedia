## Stages

La Mirada opened with a Road Stage with Chuck's tuxedo. There isn't much documentation on their stage, but Chuck's tuxedo was replaced in the 2000s with the Cool Chuck and Avenger outfits. By the end of 2013, Chuck's cap was removed. The stage remained like this until November 2022, when the stage was removed and destroyed for a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}.

The dome above the entrance was also removed. La Mirada remains like this today.
