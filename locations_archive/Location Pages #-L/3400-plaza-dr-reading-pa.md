***3400 Plaza Dr*** was a ShowBiz Pizza place that opened on December 7, 1982 and closed in early 1988. There is little to no information about this place except stories from old employees and a newspaper advertisement.

## History

This location opened on December 7, 1982 as a ShowBiz Pizza Place with the Rock Afire Explosion. An ex-employee on Facebook wrote, 'I was part of the opening crew who were there when it first opened up. What a fun job though. Best cool story for me is that I was the very first person to be "Billy Bob". Got to ride around on a tailgate to promote the openingâ€¦..then come into the restaurant and try to not step on any little kids!' The location closed sometime in 1988 due to ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc. closing locations that didn't make enough money.

## Post Closure

After this store closed, Major Magic's All Star Pizza Revue took over. Everything in the store remained intact, including the Rock-afire Explosion. It is unknown for how long the show continued to operate under Major Magic's, or if it was ever replaced at all. Major Magic's was closed by 1996. The building was later turned into a bingo hall, Jimbo's Steak and Hoagies and Your Bet convenience store.(1) Many ShowBiz remnants are still left, such as Jimbo's using an upside down 1989 sign. The three businesses are still there as of May 2025.
