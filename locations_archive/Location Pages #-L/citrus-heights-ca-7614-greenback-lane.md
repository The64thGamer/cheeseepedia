The location possibly had the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}} one one wall(0)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTjiYIOs1pw&amp;t=970s (Contains an Interview with a person who went to the store &amp; worked at {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)" >}}). the location had a {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny (Lounge)" >}}(0). The Location had a sale for Large Pizzas that would also give you a Rat tales comic book &amp; Some tokens(3). The location had Sally Sashay as their guest star along with a {{< wiki-link "Dolli Dimples (Cabaret)" >}}. In 1980, The location appeared in a Channel 40 local Sacramento news broadcasthttps://www.showbizpizza.com/info/documents/ptt/ptt\_pizzatimes-1980.pdf. The Store would be chosen to be the filming location of {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre 1979 Spot (Commercial)" >}} along with {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}}(1). In August 1981, People selected from several locations, including Citrus, were put into a contest(1). In 1981/1982, they received a minor remodel, removing some older décor for newer décor, and possibly replaced the exterior sign with the new logo along with new events like teen night &amp; adding new Guest Stars(4). The location closed in January 1985 for unknown reasons with an auction also being held on January 12th 1985. It is unknown why Citrus Heights (Greenback) closed but one possible reason could be competition from the {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (6251 Sunrise Blvd)" >}} which was only 3 minutes away. Another possible reason is that it may had been under-performing, a reason for many closures around this time. The site is now a Save on Cleaners.
