***Columbia, MO (2003 W Worley Rd)*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened on October 29, 2005 in the Stadium Plaza with a Studio C Beta and closed on June 15, 2020 with the same stage. After closure, the store would be converted into an AutoZone Auto Parts which is still open to this day.

## History

2003 W Worley Rd would open in the Stadium Plaza on October 29, 2005, with a Now Hiring advertisement being placed in the newspapers several days before they opened. They would most likely open with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} when they opened and would retain it until closure, the same goes for their Studio C Beta stage. The store would remain like this until they closed on June 15, 2020 during the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

### Post-Closure

The store would remain vacant for a little while until AutoZone Auto Parts moved in. The interior would be gutted, but the exterior would remain mostly intact, albeit repainted. As of July 2025, the building remains like this.

## Incidents

In 2012, a man was the target for a Sunday night shooting at the location. Witnesses stated that there were between 6 and 8 shell casings found. The Forensic Evidence Team would recover rounds both inside the restaurant and on the street. Nobody was injured during the shooting.
