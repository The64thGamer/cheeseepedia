## History

Fresno (Blackstone) opened on September 24th, 2002 in a freestanding building in the Villaggio Shopping Center with a Studio C Beta, 32m. They opened with the 1990s Major Remodel with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} game package. The store would remain this way until around 2013/2014 when they would remodel to the 2013 update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the removal of the 1990s Decor, Must C TV posters, and dim lighting, adding purple walls, bright florescent lighting. In February 2024, they received the 2.0 Remodel, which included a Video Wall, Interactive Dance Floor, repainting of all walls to white, new 2.0 Artwork, the 2.0 Game Package, and an exterior remodel.
