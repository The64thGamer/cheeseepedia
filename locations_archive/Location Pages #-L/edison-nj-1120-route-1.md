***1120 Route 1, Store #487*** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza that opened on September 20th, 1993, with a 1-Stage, which is still open to this day. This location received the 2.0 remodel in September-October 2022. It is located in the Edison Woods Shopping Center.

## History

Edison opened on September 20, 1993, as a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza in the Edison Woods Shopping Center with a 1-Stage. Due to New Jersey gambling laws, the store opened without any ticket redemption system or skee-ball type games. Edison remodeled to the update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in September of 2009. During the '09 remodel, Chuck E. Cheese's opened a lease on the adjacent storefront, and the wall separating Chuck E. Cheese's and the next-door property was removed, along with the existing merchandise closest. This nearly doubled the unit's square-footage. Tickets and redemption games were also added under the New Jersey Tickets Per Token System. Edison has the very first model of the Chuck E. Cheese's/Blue Bunny ice-cream vending machine, which is considered a prototype. In 2016, Edison received an update including PlayPass, 2010 carpeting, digital menu boards, the removal of SkyTubes, integrated WiFi and store server, and 6 new booth tablesets, along with a standard game package. The store was also slotted to receive a used {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} stage in 2017, presumptively from the {{< wiki-link "Wilmington, DE (3601 Silverside Rd)" >}} store. This was cancelled upon the announcement of the 2.0 test concept. During the 40 Years of Fun Celebration, Edison was one of the top 10 contributing stores to CEC's World Record Breaking of 'Most Party Blowers Blown at One Time.' The Edison Woods Shopping Center plaza signage retained a plain Thumb Chuck until Avenger signage was added in 2018. After Chuck E. Cheese began reopening stores post-COVID, Edison was CEC Entertainment's highest revenue unit due to ongoing lockdowns in California and vaccine mandates in New York City. The mandates and post closure of {{< wiki-link "Union, NJ (1660 US-22)" >}} resulted in a large share of Staten Island clientele patronizing the Edison store. Therefore, the previously cancelled 2.0 remodel of Edison was made priority #1 in New Jersey. The store was remodeled again to 2.0 beginning September 19, 2022, being wrapped up sometime in October 2022. The store's Grand Reopening took place on December 13th, 2022. As of June 2023, Edison still has the 2.0 Remodel &amp; 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall. The 2.0 remodel retained Edison's existing front doors, cashwrap countertops, salad bars, soda machines, and back-of-house equipment. New paint, signage, ticket blaster, carpeting, and other common 2.0 features were installed. Edison still has the Amutec Horse Carousel ride that has been in the store since it opened in 1993.

## Stages

The store had a 1-stage upon opening until its removal on October 5, 2022, after the Dance Floor was installed and activated. The entertainment control system was one of the first to come pre-installed with the Navori receiver. The Video Wall was installed on October 12th, 2022. The new showroom was moved to where the Alley Roller Classic games previously resided. As of June 2023, Edison still has their 2021 Model Dance Floor + Video Wall. Initially, the 1-stage had draw curtains which were replaced by lift curtains in 2001. Edison's Cyberamic Chuck E. was the very first Cyberamic produced by Animation World, delineated as Cyberamic Serial #2000.
