## History:

The Cassinelli Square Pizza Time Theater opened May 19, 1982, in the Cassinelli Square Mall. The store featured from the limited media known what was seen at your average Pizza Time Theatre. This store was untouched from opening as only 29 months after opening the store closed for good.
After closing the store would be repurposed by several different tenants such as 'Beauti Mart'<sup>(4)</sup>, and 'Finish Line'<sup>(5)</sup>. From between 1993 - Fall 1994 the process of 'de-malling' Cassinelli Square would begin. This would involve gutting the mall into just its outer shell then turning the former space into a 'strip center'. <sup>(6)</sup>As of 2024 the former shell of the mall is still being reused with the exact location of the Pizza Time Theatre within the mall unknown.
