## History

2 years after the last Louisville store closed, a new Chuck E. Cheese's opened on 2030 South Hurstbourne Parkway, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} stage, being the first Studio C stage in Kentucky, and the only Alpha to ever be installed in the State. Louisville was formerly a Discovery Zone restaurant, and when DZ closed every remaining store, Chuck E. Cheese's would acquire their assets and open many new restaurants in their place, with Louisville included. After Chuck E. Cheese's took over, the business reopened with the first Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha in the state of Kentucky, with the other being {{< wiki-link "Bowling Green, KY (2625 Scottsville Rd)" >}}, which was installed/opened in 2004. Louisville opened with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} game package and the 1993 remodel, featuring a unique awning, which all other stores in the plaza also had. In 2011, this store would remodel to the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} and replace the old artwork and games, adding new fixtures. During this time, the plaza would also remodel, giving the outlets new awnings, which the store would use. Louisville remained like this until April 1st, 2024 which they began the 2.0 remodel overnight which is now completed between mid-late April-early May, 2024. Currently, as of July 2024, the location still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
