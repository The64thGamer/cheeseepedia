***2706 Wilshire Blvd, Store #397*** was a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on April 1st, 2014 and closed on September 13th, 2020. This location also had a special mural near the windows that would be fully visible from outside.

## Stages

As the location was being planned in 2011, it was originally going to house a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}}. But ever since it was pushed back it eventually got a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} show with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 16m (Animatronic)" >}}.

## History

The earliest documentation of this location being developed goes back to September 2011. However the construction for this location prolonged into 2014, making this the last location to open with a 'Cool Chuck' exterior and interior. Throughout 2014 they had valet parking service outside, but by 2015 it ended. In June of 2020, CEC Entertainment files for bankruptcy and they started to purge several locations that were underperforming, and this location warranted closure, closing on September 13th, 2020. As of now, the space is for lease.
