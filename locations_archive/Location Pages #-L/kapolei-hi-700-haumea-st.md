***Kapolei, HI (700 Haumea St.)* is a franchise *Chuck E. Cheese* that opened in October 2018 and is still open. Due to long construction, this location is the last to open with the CEC 2015 Remodel Program|2015 Remodel and the last to feature {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} with an animatronic. It is also the only COL with an animatronic to feature a dance floor.**

## History

Kapolei began construction around 2015/2016 and was a learning experience for the franchisee. The location finished in 2018 and later opened the same year. This ended up being an interesting location, containing the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} (a bigger Chuck E's Clubhouse variant) and Avenger-era costumes. As of 2024, Kapolei remains like this.

## Costumes

more coming soon...

## Stage

Kapolei has a interesting stage, having a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} Stage with a 2017 Dance Floor and a 16M Chuck E bot. Unfortunately, The animatronic is in poor condition, judging off a performance in 2022. Also, it has been leaned forward ever since opening in 2018.
