***2333-A Forest Dr, Store #50*** is a Chuck E. Cheese in Annapolis, Maryland, in the Festival at Riva Shopping Center that opened on April 10th, 1993, and is still open to this day.

## History

Annapolis opened on April 10th, 1993, at the Festival at Riva Shopping Center with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. The store would receive its first remodel around the Mid-Late 1990's which included the removal of the Ball Crawl for the SkyTubes and the changing of the exterior logo (The letters were surprisingly white instead of Red and Yellow). Annapolis would remain this way until Summer of 2011 when they would receive the 2010 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing the Showroom walls, Balcony Seating, redoing the Ordering Counter, Salad Bar, reconfiguring the Kid Check area, and remodeling the exterior (As well as changing the color of the letters from white to red). March 5th 2016 Annapolis started to revamp their exterior ( But they kept the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} sign) and then replaced their Emergency Exit Doors in the showroom. During this process the Skytubes were removed. In 2019 a water leak would occur above the Helen animatronic, causing its mask to collect mold and water damage. In August 2024, the Helen animatronic's mask caught severe mold on it, and prompted negative reactions from fans online, more specifically from a Reddit post.https://www.reddit.com/r/chuckecheese/comments/1eqpfc3/moldy\_helen\_henny\_animatronic/ As of now, Annapolis still has the 2-Stage and 2010 Update.

## Stages

When Annapolis first opened, they received a 2-Stage. This is one of the few 2-Stages that doesn't have Pasqually's Brick Wall onstage. By 2000, the side to side curtains were replaced with Up and Down curtains. This is one of the few stores that opened after 2006 not to ever have the Cool Chuck outfit. By 2008, the Tuxedo &amp; Derby was replaced with the Avenger outfit. In the Early-Mid 2010's, Pasqually's drumhead was changed from the Orange Swirl from when they opened to the Explosion Drumhead they still have to this day. In September 2013, Chuck's Avenger Cap was removed. Sometime in 2016-2017 a ceiling tile caused leaking damaging Helen's mask. In August 2024, the Helen animatronic's mask caught severe mold on it, and prompted negative reactions from online.(0) As of now, Annapolis still has their 2-Stage.
