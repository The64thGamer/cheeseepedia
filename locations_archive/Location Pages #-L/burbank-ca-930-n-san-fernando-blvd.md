## History

Burbank opened on December 28, 1999 on top of a former Discovery Zone store. It originally had {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}}, which had late 90s decor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Alpha stage. Burbank remained like this until 2009/2010, when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which removed most of the 90s decor for new decor, tearing down the showroom walls, removed the dim lighting, painting the walls purple, and added new games and rides. Strangely, the exterior stayed (almost) the same. In the mid-late 2010s, the Skytubes were removed for more games and rides. As of July 2023, Burbank still remains like this.
