## History

## Stages

Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until around 1991-1992, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. In the Mid 1990's Chuck's mask was replaced with a newer one. The store would remain this way until closure.
