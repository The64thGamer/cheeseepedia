**Johnstown, PA (1523 Scalp Ave)** was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened in 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}, and closed in 1989. Little info is known about this location except for a few articles.

## History

Johnstown opened in 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion. It had everything a normal ShowBiz Pizza would have to offer. They did not receive the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}} with the Camp Ground Stage. In 1989, the location caught fire and closed. Consequently, the business would move down the road to the Bel Air Plaza and open **'Showplace Pizza**' in 1989. Not much is known about {{< wiki-link "Johnstown, PA (850 Scalp Ave)" >}}, other than it kept the Rock-afire Explosion (Presumably from 1523 Scalp Ave) and was most likely created in refusal to undergo Concept Unification. Showplace Pizza would later close in 1994.
