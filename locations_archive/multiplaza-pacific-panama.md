Multiplaza Pacific Mall, Panama City, Panama is a Chuck E Cheese's that opened on early 2013 (date unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} stage with a 16M animatronic. It is located on the third floor of Multiplaza Mall.

## History

Because of their expansion in Latin America, Chuck E Cheese's decided to open a location in Panama.
The store opened in 2013 to much fanfare, so much so that a second location opened in 2017.

## Exterior and Interior

This location is a very early version of the 2013 Update remodel, having a prototype of the International Mall Entrance, and many things that are not from the 2013 Update, including the "Kids" Posters from the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} and the toddler playground from that remodel.
The store also has a checkered wall that is actually a window, looking to the road outside the mall.
