***3329 E Bell Rd, Store #214/3207*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened on March 26, 1999, and closed in January 2015 (day unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}. This is not to be confused with {{< wiki-link "Phoenix, AZ (8039 North 35th Ave)" >}}, which opened on October 28, 1983, as a ShowBiz Pizza Place, received {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} in 1990, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

## Stage

This location had a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}, one of 3 in Arizona. There isn't a ton of info known about it, though. After the 2015 closure, the Alpha was moved to {{< wiki-link "Chandler, AZ (2977 West Frye Rd)" >}}, where it remained until the location received 2.0 in 2023.

## History

Phoenix (Bell) opened on March 26, 1999, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} and the {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} game package. However, there is not much information on this location in general, however. Around 2006/2007, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor for new decor, removing the showroom walls and balcony seating, adding purple walls, and changing the exterior. Phoenix (Bell) remained like this until January 2015 (day unknown), when they closed permanently for unknown reasons. The building remained vacant for a few months until Dollar Tree opened on the space. As of April 2025, Dollar Tree is still on the space.
