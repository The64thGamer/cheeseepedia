***2215 SW Wanamaker Rd, Store #961*** is a Chuck E. Cheese that opened in December 1990 (day unknown) as a franchise store with a Road Stage, which is still open to this day. This location is the first Chuck E. Cheese to open in Kansas as just ShowBiz Pizzas opened prior to its opening. It is located in the West Ridge Plaza Shopping Mall. Their exterior is actually unique as it was also seen in the {{< wiki-link "Wichita, KS (3223 N Rock Rd)" >}} location.

## History

Topeka opened in December 1990 as the first Chuck E. Cheese in Kansas and as a franchised-owned store. Topeka opened with the 1988 remodel and originally featured the Road Stage, the Blue and White Awnings, the CU decor, and the checkers around the store. In the mid 1990s, Topeka received a minor remodel removing older CU decor for the Record Posters and Colored Chase Lights. On September 16th, 1996, the location was sold to corporate along with 18 other locations. In the late 1990's, Topeka would receive the 'Phase 3' remodel removing older decor for newer decor, and removing the ball pit for SkyTubes. Topeka would remain like this until in 2007 when they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative removing older Phase 3 decor for newer decor, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, relocating the stage, and expanded to fit in more games and tables. Topeka would remain like this until in July 2022, when they would receive the 2.0 remodel, this involved removing the Road Stage and replacing it with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}. Strangely, they kept the original 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' road sign shape when it first opened in December 1990. Currently, as of March 2023, Topeka still has the 2.0 remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.

## Stages

Originally, Topeka featured a Road Stage. Like all Road Stages when they first opened, Chuck wore his Tuxedo &amp; Derby outfit. Also, the stage featured no curtains like any other Road Stage from when it was first installed. Up and Down Curtains were added by 1997 during one of the store's remodels. In July 2022, Topeka would replace their Road Stage with a Dance Floor and Video Wall, as part of their 2.0 remodel. It was one of 2 Road Stages in Kansas. The other road stage was {{< wiki-link "Wichita, KS (3223 N Rock Rd)" >}}. As of March 2023, Topeka still has the 2.0 Remodel and Dance Floor + Video Wall.
