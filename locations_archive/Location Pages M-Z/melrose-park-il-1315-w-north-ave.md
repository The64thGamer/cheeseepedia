## Stages

Melrose Park opened with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}}. The stage was installed almost on the ground because the ceiling was low. It didn't last long, as it was replaced with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} by 1994/1995. The stage received minor changes until the 2012 closure. Changes include Pasqually getting a new drum set, Chuck E. receiving the Cool Chuck outfit (later Avenger), Chuck E. getting a new mask by 2008, Helen getting a new mask sometime in the 2000s, Jasper getting a new mask in 2008-2009, and Pasqually getting a new mask in the 2000s.
