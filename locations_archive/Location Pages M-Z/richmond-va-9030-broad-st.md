## History

Henrico opened on March 4, 1999, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} and the {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} remodel. Barely any information on Henrico exists at this time. In 2008/2009, Henrico received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor, showroom walls, balcony seating, added purple walls, and changed the exterior. In September 2023 the store received 2.0 removing all older decor and replacing it with modern decor. As of October 2023, the store remains open with the 2.0 remodel.
