## History

### Opening

The first mention of the Florin store would be on July 28th, 1979 for a job listing for the opening staff.(4) The store would open on August 14, 1979.(0) Some time before December of 1979, Florin Center would change its name to the now Florin Mall. The store would celebrate by displaying a PTT themed taxi in the mall itself, alongside hosting a draw for a $1,000 'Dolli Dimples Party'. Bernice Hing would win the draw and bring in 105 guests for the party.(1) Florin's Assistant Manager Ben Kline would be one of the first to complete Pizza Time Theatre's Management Training Program.(6) Another Assistant Manager, Randy Morse, would later become one of the training staff for the program in 1981. During the opening of {{< wiki-link "Citrus Heights, CA (7614 Greenback Lane)" >}} on December 26, 1979, the District Manager Roger Berke had to deliver pizzas from the Florin location to Cirtus Heights due to the store's gas lines not being turned on yet.(2)

### 1980

Some time before May of 1980, Scott Nelson, a former assistant manager for {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}} during its opening, would be named manager of the Florin Mall location. He would be Pizza Time Theatre's youngest manager at the time- being just 21.(8)

### 1983

In early 1983 Florin would receive the award for best performance in the Northern California area for training employees for 1982.(9) At the same time Florin alongside Sacramento, CA (7020 Stockton Blvd), Lodi, CA, {{< wiki-link "Modesto, CA (3037 Sisk Rd)" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Sacramento, CA (1690-96 Arden Way)" >}} would host a dough rolling tournament. It is unknown which store won.

### Closing

The store would be held for auction on December 14, 1985 at 10AM. It is unknown if the store had already closed before then.(1)
