Cheese's* that opened on October 26th, 1982 as a corporate store with a Rock-Afire Explosion, the store closed in 2002 (Possibly Late August-Early September).

## History

### Pre SPP/CEC (November 22nd, 1965-1982)

The space that would house the Walker SPP/CEC would open on November 22nd, 1965 as a Kmart Foods Grocery Store which was the former Grocery Store division for Kmart. It would remain as Kmart Foods until it went out of business and then became a Eberhard Grocery Store which was closed by 1982, sometime after, the construction of the Walker ShowBiz Pizza Place would begin with the opening occurring in October.

### ShowBiz Pizza Place &amp; Chuck E. Cheese (October 26th, 1982-1991 &amp; 1991-2002)

Walker opened on October 26th, 1982 as the third ShowBiz Pizza Place in Michigan (3rd after {{< wiki-link "Southgate, MI (15300 Toledo Rd)" >}} &amp; {{< wiki-link "Saginaw, MI (5105 Bay Rd)" >}}) as a Corporate owned store. Walker originally featured the Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. they would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would receive Concept Unification, where the Rock-Afire Explosion characters were changed to the Chuck E. Cheese characters. In the Mid-Late 1990's, Walker would receive another remodel. The store would remain this way until they closed and relocated to {{< wiki-link "Walker, MI (3108 Alpine Ave NW)" >}} in possibly the former Kids R Us in September 2002; they would open with a Studio C Beta, 32m and would have it until 2018 when it was replaced with a 2017 Model {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and still operates to this day.

### Post CEC (2002-Present)

Sometime after the relocation and closure, the location's exterior along with the former Kmart next to it would be redone beyond recognition and converted into a Shopping Plaza called 'Summit Alpine'. As of May 2023, Summit Alpine still operates to this day.

## Stages

Originally, Walker featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. In 1991, they would undergo Concept Unification, turning the Rock-Afire Explosion into the 3-Stage. Walker would have the 3-Stage until 2002 (Possibly Late August-Early September) when the 3-Stage was removed due to the location permanently closing and relocating across the street.
