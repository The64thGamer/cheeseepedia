## History

Manchester opened in August 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}, It is currently the oldest Chuck E. Cheese's location in New England. Corporate purchased the store on February 2nd, 1987 along with {{< wiki-link "Danvers, MA (139 Endicott St)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd)" >}}. The store was originally franchised by The Wendworth Company.(1) Manchester housed the Balcony Stage from 1982 until 1989 when they would receive the 1988 Remodel and convert the Balcony into the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. They also featured The King in the Cabaret Room. In 1993, Manchester would receive the 1993 Remodel. They would convert the Chuck E.'s House Facade into a 2-Stage, as well as remove The King. In December 2005, Manchester would receive the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}. The 2-Stage would end up being removed not too long after, being replaced with a Studio C Beta |Studio C Beta, 16M in January 2006. Starting with this store, Studio C Beta's and other Studio C's being installed after this would install the fake curtains to save money. After the 2-Stage removal, Pieces of the 2-Stage would end up being parted out to {{< wiki-link "Newington, NH (30 Fox Run Rd)" >}}. The Gameroom and Showroom would end up being relocated for this remodel, as the Studio C would be placed in the former Gameroom at the front of the store, and the Gameroom would be in the former Showroom at the back of the store. In Spring 2011, Manchester would receive an expansion. The Showroom would be relocated to the now expanded back of the store, the bathrooms would be relocated, and the entrance would be moved. In Fall 2020, Manchester would remove the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} and Toddler Zone. due to COVID-19. In Spring 2022, Manchester would replace the Studio C head with {{< wiki-link "Orange, CT (82 Boston Post Rd)" >}}. The original head was destroyed. On September 19th, 2022, Manchester's Studio C ceased programming. In September 2023, Manchester started its 2.0 remodel. The Studio C Beta stage was removed and replaced with a Dance Floor and Video Wall, making the Dance Floor the only stage type in New Hampshire. In April 2024, according to Chuck E. Cheese CEO David Mckillips on Instagram, Manchester, along with {{< wiki-link "Everett, MA (29 Mystic View Rd)" >}}, were confirmed to get Trampoline Zones. It was installed on May 4th.

## Trivia
