## History

Victorville opened on December 14, 1999, with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} remodel and a Studio C (1997)|Studio C Alpha. A few years later between 2000 and 2002, they received {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}}. Around 2007, they received the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all 90s decor, removing showroom walls and balcony seating, expanded the store, added purple walls, and changed the exterior. The {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} were removed sometime in the mid-late 2010s. In April 2022, Victorville received the 2.0 remodel, removing the Studio C Alpha for a 2021 Model {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Video Wall" >}}. The grand reopening occurred on June 2, 2022. As of August 2023, Victorville remains operational with the 2.0 remodel.
