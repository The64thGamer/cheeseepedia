***1030 Winston Plaza*** is a *Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened in September 2012 (day unknown) with a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} and is still open today with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}. This is the relocation of {{< wiki-link "Melrose Park, IL (1315 W North Ave)" >}}, which opened on September 24, 1991 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Road Stage" >}} and closed in August 2012 with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}.

## Stage

Melrose Park would originally feature a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} stage with a Chuck E. bot. Around 2013, his cap was removed, and on September 19, 2022, the bot ceased programming due to Navori. On September 1, 2024, they removed their bot during their 2.0 remodel. Due to the PODS container outside the store being halfway opened and empty, its possible that both the bot and artwork had been placed in here and later stolen, but that remains unconfirmed, as the bot could've been at the bottom of the dumpster instead. As for the artwork, the person who had made the Reddit post announcing their remodel stated that there didn't seem to be any artwork in the dumpster.

## History

Melrose Park opened in September 2012 as the relocation of the old store on North Avenue. It featured a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}} and the 2010 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative. The store remained mainly untouched since opening, besides the removal of the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}}. Their biggest change would occur in September 1, 2024, which is when they would begin their 2.0 remodel and removed their bot, but the Circles Of Light backdrop would remain in place. As of July 2025, Melrose Park remains like this.
