***1422 S Robert Street*** was a *ShowBiz Pizza Place* that opened on September 23, 1982, and closed in October 1985. The location became a Circus Pizza around 1988 and closed in the mid-1990's. After Circus Pizza's departure, the location became a *Chuck E. Cheese's* on August 9, 1999, and closed in the fall of 2019.

## Stages

Originally, this location opened with the {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}}. The Circus Pizza that followed also had a classic Rock-afire Explosion show, but it is unclear if the same animatronics were used. When Chuck E. Cheese opened in August 1999, the show was replaced by a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}. However, this Studio C Alpha stage was unique in that it used the original footprint of the existing stage, similar to that of the {{< wiki-link "Awesome Adventure Machine" >}} or the {{< wiki-link "Darien, IL (7409 Cass Ave)" >}} location's {{< wiki-link "CU Beta 16M" >}}. The show did not feature the Apple TV. Additionally, the stage used an earlier version of the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese 32m (Animatronic)" >}} that had eyelashes (1). In 2005, the curtains were disabled on the stage. In 2013, Chuck E.'s cap was replaced.

## History

As a *Chuck E. Cheese's*, the store re-opened to resemble the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} and included character posters and other fixtures from the 1998/1999 art packages. It was sometime between 2006 and 2007 when the location was updated for the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, in which only the interior was remodeled. The interior remodel led to the removal of the Showroom Walls and Balcony Seating, and the salad bar was relocated, along with a few existing arcade machines. In Summer 2013, the location received a new walkaround character costume. The location closed in the fall of 2019. After it closed, the building was gutted and was replaced by a AutoZone.
