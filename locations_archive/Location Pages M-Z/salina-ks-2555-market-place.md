### Closing

By January of 1984 the store would be reduced to 20 employees from its opening 80. Its manager was by then Steve Hilton. Steve would learn of his store's eventual closure in December of 1983, due to radio advertisements for his store set to air before New Years Eve being cancelled.

The store would set to close the coming Sunday on January 8th.(1)
