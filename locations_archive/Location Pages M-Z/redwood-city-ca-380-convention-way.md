## History

RSKT, Inc., franchisee of the {{< wiki-link "Sunnyvale, CA (1247 W El Camino Real)" >}} and Milpitas, CA (346 S Abel St) locations would open Redwood City as their third franchise in August of 1981.(2) In Summer of 1982, the location's CEC Mascot would present with Donna Clark, Miss Redwood City of 1982, a proclamation of 'Chuck E. Cheese Day' for the city of Redwood on an uncited day.(3)

### Angel Island Run

On May 7, 1983, the location would sponsor the *12th Annual Angel Island Run* to help raise money for underprivileged children. Over 1,500 participants would run the 4.8-mile race along an island in San Francisco Bay. Multiple corporate members would attend the event:

- Marketing: Pat Saign, Don Schulte
- Finance: Steve Merchant
- Wardrobe: Tine Ahmann
- Graphics: Karen Mitchell

Don Schulte would run the race in a Chuck E. Cheese mascot costume, clocking in at 44 minutes, ahead of most other runners. Other costume characters would greet people on the island, whether in the race or not. A 30-foot inflatable Chuck E. Cheese was set up on a hill in the island, visible to passing sailboats.(4)

### Auction

The location would hold a closing auction on February 8, 1986, at 10AM.(0) The auction would sell 'Video Games, Kiddie Rides, Amusements, Cyberamics System, Like-New Restaurant Equipment'. An unknown buyer would confirm to have bought Chuck E. Cheese, Helen Henny, Pasqually, Munch, heads of Madam Oink, Harmony Howlette, and Dolli Dimples, a Cyberamics Control Center, a box of controller cards, signage, the Clapper Board, and the Band Board. These would later go up for auction again in the 2010's. *80's Girl / Kobun37* would get the Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic, and the rest sent with Damon E. Breland.(1)
