They later received {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} in their respective years.

In around the late 2010s, the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} were removed. In October 2023 Springfield, MO would begin its 2.0 refresh. As of July 2024, Springfield remains like this with the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor with the Video Wall.
