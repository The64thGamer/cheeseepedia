Pico Rivera had the stage and the store unchanged until the late 80s when they received the 1988 remodel. They removed the Balcony Stage for the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} and added new decor. They would remain like this until their second remodel in the mid-late 90's. They then removed the C-Stage for the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} removed the 1988 Remodel decor and added new decor and SkyTubes. They would remain like this until the installation of the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} between 2008-2009 when they removed the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and relocated the 2-Stage. In 2010, the 2-Stage was converted into a 1-Stage.
