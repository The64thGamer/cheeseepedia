## History

East Orlando opened on June 21, 2000 with the 1990s Major Remodel|1993 remodel, which included some late '90s and early 2000's décor, Skytubes, and the Studio C Alpha stage. The store remained like this until Fall 2014 when they received the 2013 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which involved removing all of the older décor for newer Rockstar décor, removing the balcony seating, tearing down the Showroom walls, and replacing the dim lighting with brighter, fluorescent lighting. The Studio C Alpha was left behind. Also, this store along with West Orlando and Tampa were known for their contributions by CEC Florida, mostly on their shows. East Orlando began the 2.0 remodel in April 2023, removing/destroying the Studio C Alpha on April 16, 2023 in favor of a Dance Floor and a Video Wall. The store's grand reopening happened on May 17, 2023, which was CEC's 46th anniversary. As of June 2023, East Orlando still has the 2.0 remodel.

## Stages

The store had a Studio C Alpha, which was installed in June 2000 when the store opened. Between the late 2000s and early 2010s, both the Blue Screen and the Interactive Console were removed in favor of the Ticket Blaster, which was installed likely in 2010. The Alpha remained like this until April 16, 2023, when the stage was removed as part of the 2.0 remodel for a Video Wall and Dance Floor.
