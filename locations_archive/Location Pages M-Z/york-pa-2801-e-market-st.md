## History

## Stages

Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. They would have it for a few years, until around 1991, when they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to turn the RAE into the CEC characters. In September 2018, they remodeled to 2.0, removing the 3-Stage for a 2017 Model Dance Floor.
