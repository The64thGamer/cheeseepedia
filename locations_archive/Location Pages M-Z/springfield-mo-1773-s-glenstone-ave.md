## History

Springfield opened on April 20, 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. Unfortunately, there is basically no information on this store at all. The store closed on December 31, 1983 for unknown reasons. The store held an auction in January 1984, and as a result, the location was vacant. It was left like this way for multiple years, until Midnight Rodeo moved onto the space. As of August 2023, Midnight Rodeo occupies the space.
