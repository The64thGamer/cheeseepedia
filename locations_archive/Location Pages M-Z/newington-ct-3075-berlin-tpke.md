***3075 Berlin Tpke, Store #470*** is a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} location located in Newington, Connecticut. This location opened on October 29, 1991, as the sister store to {{< wiki-link "Norwalk, CA (10949 Firestone Blvd)" >}}.

## Stages

This location opened up on October 29, 1991, as the first location in Connecticut since the closures of {{< wiki-link "New Britain, CT (222 E Main St)" >}} &amp; {{< wiki-link "Orange, CT (260 Bull Hill Lane)" >}} in 1985 with a Road Stage and was converted to a 1-Stage sometime in 1995. The 1-Stage is different than normal 1-Stages as it has the 2-stage props (which was the only one of its kind in New England as the other 1-Stages in New England has the finalized design). In January 2011, the Tuxedo &amp; Derby was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Chuck's cap was removed in September 2013. The Munchâ€™s Make Believe Band sign was removed in around 2016. The sign was never replaced after that. The Avenger outfit would be replaced by the Rockstar outfit in March 2018. Munch's hat was removed around July 2022. It remained this way until they received the 2.0 Remodel.

## History

The store received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} in the Fall of 2005. In August 2022, they started their 2.0 Remodel which removed the 1-Stage and placed the Video Wall on the right side wall where some of the 2005 remodel posters once stood. This was one of the five New England locations that were open after 2006 that did not receive the Cool Chuck outfit. Those other four were {{< wiki-link "Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Waterbury, CT (650 Wolcott St)" >}}, &amp; {{< wiki-link "Attleboro, MA (287 Washington St)" >}}.
