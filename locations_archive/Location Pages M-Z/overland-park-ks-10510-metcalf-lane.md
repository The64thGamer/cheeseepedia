***Overland Park, KS (10510 Metcalf Lane), Store #67*** is a *ShowBiz Pizza Place* restaurant located in Overland Park, Kansas which opened on September 29, 1980. It is currently the only remaining ShowBiz Pizza in Kansas after {{< wiki-link "Manhattan, KS (519 Richards Dr)" >}} closed in 1993.

## History

Overland Park, KS opened its doors on September 29th, 1980 as the first store in Kansas. This was one of 18/19 stores to receive a Beta RockAfire Explosion show, though it was very still unique in several ways. In 1991-1992, Concept Unification was growing strong, Replacing the RockAfire Explosion with Munch's Make Believe Band. It also was a franchised location until February 25th, 1985 when they were bought by the corporate along with {{< wiki-link "Independence, MO (4039 S Noland Rd)" >}}. Then store would receive the 1993 remodel sometime by the 1990s, complete with: Platinum CD Award posters; Mt. Chuckmore poster; 1991 Postcard posters (Pasqually's Italy and Jasper's Wild West); Cheese Guitar sign; 1993 Salad Bar, Beverages and Round Chuck signs; 1991 Confetti Portraits; and other misc signage. In 2000, Overland Park would remodel once again, this time to Phase 3 which involved remodeling the exterior, destroying the 3-Stage for the Studio C Beta, 32m stage and removing some old decor. In Early-Mid 2007, Overland Park would receive the CEC 2005 Remodel|2005 Remodel; removing the 90's decorations, knocking down the Showroom walls, removing the balcony seating, adding purple walls. It is unknown when they received the Cool Chuck outfit. In 2017, Overland Park started their 2.0 Remodel as one of the first of the 7 2.0's. The stage was removed in 2017.

## Stages

Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion, they were the 3rd RAE installed, and had the 'Beta' bots, which had hollow frames, unlike the later ones, which have solid frames. In around 1991 or 1992, they would undergo Concept Unification, this was the process used to convert the RAE characters into the Chuck E. Cheese characters.
