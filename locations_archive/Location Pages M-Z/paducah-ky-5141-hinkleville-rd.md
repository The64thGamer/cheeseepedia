***5141 Hinkleville Rd, Store #226/2021/113*** was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on December 9, 1982 with a Rock-Afire Explosion, which is still open to this day This location received {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}} in September 1992, and received the 2.0 remodel in 2018.

## History

The store opened on December 9, 1982 as a ShowBiz Pizza Place. It was initially owned by a company called PUMEZCO, Inc. (whose name came from its founders, Jim **Pu**llen and Bill **Me**t**z**ger) who also owned {{< wiki-link "Cape Girardeau, MO (250 S Silver Springs Rd)" >}} Very little information is known about this store during its time as a ShowBiz, other than a few pictures of its exterior. In September of 1992, the store underwent Concept Unification, and in November of that year, 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza' signs were installed. In April of 1996, the store began receiving the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1990's Remodel Program" >}} benefits. The interior decor was updated, and the following month, the exterior was refinished and 'Thumb Chuck' signs were added. The interior and exterior design would remain mostly unchanged until 2.0, with the exception of the showroom walls being painted purple sometime in the mid-2010s. Throughout the 4th quarter of 2018, the store began the 2.0 process, receiving a 2017-model {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and 'Chuck E. Cheese Pizzeria And Games' signage.

## Stages

Originally the store had a Rock-Afire Explosion show, as all other ShowBiz stores did, and would have this for a few years until September 1992, when the store would undergo a process known as Concept Unification, this was to replace the RAE with the Chuck E. Cheese characters. Paducah was one of the last stores to get CU, as a majority had either gotten it the year prior or before September 1992. A very unique thing is that they kept the old ShowBiz wall paneling that was on the sides of the stage, and was the last store to have them. In 2018, the store would be selected as one of the stores to test the brand new at the time, 'CEC Pizzeria &amp; Games' remodel, otherwise known as the 2.0 remodel, this would involve completely overhauling the store, painting inside and outside, new logos, new 'Chuck E. Cheese' wording being Chuck E.'s signature, new wall art, new carpet, new tables, booths, and chairs, removal of the animatronic stage and replacing it with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}}. Paducah was the last 3-Stage in the state of Kentucky, as the Lexington location received a Studio C Beta, 16m in 2007 or 2008. Paducah was also the second-last Munch's Make Believe Band stage in Kentucky, with the {{< wiki-link "Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)" >}} location having a 2-Stage, Florence received 2.0 in March of 2022, meaning there are no more MMBB stages in Kentucky, or Cyberamic stages, since all others closed prior to the year 2000.
