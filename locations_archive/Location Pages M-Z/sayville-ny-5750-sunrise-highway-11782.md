Fun Station USA was a family entertainment center in Sayville, New York. It was one of several Fun Station USA locations, and featured the Rock Afire explosion animated show. The show was performing at the location until 2008, when it was sold to Scandia Golf & Games.

## Features of the restaurant

Besides the animatronic show, Fun Station USA featured a "Mega Maze" play zone. These indoor play places were popular at family entertainment centers in the 1990s, and many of these locations with animatronic shows sprung up rather than arcades around this time. The center also had a carousel, laser tag, kiddie rides, and bumper cars. Birthday packages were sold and parties advertised the animatronic show as part of the birthday experience.

## The animatronic show

The animatronic show was purchased from Creative Engineering when the fun center opened. It had the full 3 stage show with all of the characters. They appeared in their typical cosmetics, with no outfit changes besides minor accessories added such as the birthday hats shown to the right. Instead of a normal stage bottom, the stage here was carpeted with neon black light carpet.
