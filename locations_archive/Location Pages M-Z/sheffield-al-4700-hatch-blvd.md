***4700 Hatch Blvd, Store #2091*** was a *ShowBiz Pizza Place* that opened on August 1st, 1984, as an independently franchised location with a {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} and is still open to this very day.

## History

Sheffield opened its doors on August 1st, 1984, as the tenth and last ShowBiz Pizza store in Alabama. Like many other ShowBiz Pizza locations, it had a typical SPP layout as seen in many other stores across the United States. Sheffield received the 1988 remodel in 1988-1989 removing older SPP decor for newer decor, a slight exterior remodel, and received the ShowBiz Pizza Campground upgrade. Unfortunately, there is hardly any documentation of Sheffield back then. In 1991, Sheffield received Concept Unification removing all SPP decor for newer decor, added an exterior change, and removed the Rock-Afire Explosion band for the 3-Stage. In the early-mid 90's, Sheffield underwent a minor remodel removing some decor for newer decor. Around the Late 90's, Sheffield received the so-called 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, and SkyTubes. Sheffield would remain like this until 2006-2007 when they received the 2005 remodel removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing older 2000's decor for newer decor, a new exterior change, and the relocation of the stage. Sheffield remained like this until 2020 when they received the 2.0 remodel, removing the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor. Strangely, the 2005 Remodel ({{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}) signs on the building and in the road were kept. Currently, as of February 2023, Sheffield still has the 2.0 remodel and the Dance Floor.

## Stages

Originally, Sheffield featured a Rock-Afire Explosion, as all other ShowBiz locations did. Unfortunately, there are no photos or videos to exist of Sheffield with the Rock afire, or as a ShowBiz in general. they got Concept Unification sometime in 1991. In 2020, Sheffield removed the 3-Stage for the Dance Floor for their 2.0 remodel.

## Trivia

- Sheffield was the tenth and last ShowBiz Pizza Place to open in Alabama.
- Sheffield was one of seven ShowBiz locations in Alabama to be converted into Chuck E. Cheese. The other six are {{< wiki-link "Mobile, AL (710 Downtowner Loop)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Huntsville, AL (1220 Jordan Lane)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Montgomery, AL (2940 E South Blvd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Birmingham, AL (500 Old Town Rd)" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Birmingham, AL (9325 Parkway East)" >}}, &amp; {{< wiki-link "Dothan, AL (3400 Ross Clark Circle)" >}}. The other three ShowBiz locations Tuscaloosa, AL (1335 McFarland Blvd)|Tuscaloosa, {{< wiki-link "Cullman, AL (210 2nd Ave)" >}}, &amp; {{< wiki-link "Midfield, AL (34 Phillips Dr)" >}} closed in December 1985 (Tuscaloosa), &amp; April 1986 (Cullman &amp; Midfield) respectively as they were the only three not to make it to Concept Unification. Midfield's show however ended up undergoing Concept Unification when it was installed at the {{< wiki-link "Tallahassee, FL (2810 Sharer Rd)" >}} location.
- This is also the last Franchised location in Alabama as the others were either bought out by Corporate or closed.
