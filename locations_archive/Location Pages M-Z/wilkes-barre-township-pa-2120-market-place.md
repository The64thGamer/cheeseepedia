***2120 Market Place, Store #533*** is a Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s that opened on April 21st, 2004 with a Small-Town Studio C, which is still open to this day. Wilkes-Barre started the 2.0 remodel on March 20th and completed it on May 11th.

## Stages

The store opened with the Small-Town Studio C and was one of 4 in Pennsylvania. It was removed in March 2023 for the Dance Floor and the Video Wall has been installed.

## History

Wilkes-Barre opened on April 21st, 2004 in the Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace (Alongside the now closed Butler, PA (101 Clearwater Circle)|Butler, PA location) with the Small Town Studio C &amp; the Cool Chuck outfit. They then remodeled to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in around 2010-2012 which was an interior only (Keeping the Beverages Sign from opening) remodel and replacing the letters on the exterior. At some unknown point, Wilkes-Barre would expand into a neighboring beauty salon, most likely around their 2010-2012 remodel. The Cool Chuck shirt was replaced in around 2015-2016 with a Rockstar Shirt. In around 2018-2019, the Khaki Shorts were replaced with Rockstar Jeans. As of 2023, Wilkes-Barre has removed its 2005 update as of March 20th and its Phase 3 decor as of March 21st. The Cappa was removed a week later for the 2021 Model Dance Floor &amp; Video Wall. Wilkes-Barre removed their signage on April 5th and received their new Chuck E. Cheese lettering in early May. Additionally, the exterior was repainted again after the mid-April repaint. The remodel concluded on May 11th, with the exception being that the new sign did not arrive in time for the grand reopening.
