***Montclair, CA (5399 Moreno Street, Space B)*** was a planned {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's" >}} to open around 2002-2003 in the Montclair East Shopping Center. The store would've most likely had {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta" >}} if completed. This location should not be confused with the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} that previously operated nearby in {{< wiki-link "Montclair, CA (5060 E Montclair Plaza Lane)" >}}.

## History

On August 14th, 2002, *The Los Angeles Times* reported Chuck E. Cheese's had leased most of the former Kids 'R' Us in Montclair, which shut down on August 11th, 2002 as part of the closure wave of 64 stores by Toys 'R' Us.(1) No further news ever surfaced of the location, and it can be assumed it was cancelled. The store space intended for CEC would eventually become a Dollar Tree after remaining vacant for a few years.

## Stages

This location (if opened) would house one of the few Studio C Beta's in California, especially the southern side alongside {{< wiki-link "Fullerton, CA (1134 S Harbor Blvd)" >}}
