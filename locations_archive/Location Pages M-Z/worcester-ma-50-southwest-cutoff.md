***Worcester, MA (50 Southwest Cutoff), Store #459*** is a *Chuck E. Cheese* location that opened in August 1992 with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}, and is still open to this day with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}.

## History

Worcester opened on August 18th, 1992 in Southwest Commons. The location originally featured a 2-Stage. Unlike many of them at the time, this location had Jasper's banjo, much like {{< wiki-link "Burlington, MA (10 Wall St)" >}}. Sometime from 1995-1997, they changed out their original sign for a Coach Chuck sign. Between 1999-2002, some changes were made to the characters, including Helen and Pasqually getting a new mask and Jasper's shirt, Pasqually's apron, and Helen's dress being replaced. Chuck received the Cool Chuck outfit that year as well, and the stage switched to lift curtains by 2004, which is when they were disabled. That fall, Worcester remodeled to the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, which made it the first CEC in Massachusetts to get the remodel. The stage remained the same until the 2010s rolled around, when Helen again got her third mask, and Chuck had the Avenger shirt by this time. In 2013, Chuck got his khakis replaced with Avenger shorts, the Munch's Make Believe Band sign was removed, and Jasper's banjo was broken in half, being replaced with the 3-Stage cheese guitar. The lift curtains were removed the next year. Worcester would remain mostly the same after this, except for Pasqually's drum being flipped around, and the {{< wiki-link "Ticket Blaster" >}} decal placed on the now front side. In October of 2021, Worcester removed their 2-Stage, to be replaced by the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Live Stage (Dance Floor)" >}} and Video Wall as part of the remodel to 2.0. The top halves of Chuck E., Helen, and Jasper would be sent to {{< wiki-link "Lowell, MA (199 Plain St)" >}}, replacing their original halves. Pasqually's mask would make its way to {{< wiki-link "North Dartmouth, MA (412-418 State Rd)" >}} to replace their mask. Worcester had their grand reopening ceremony on January 12th, 2022, where {{< wiki-link "Helen Henny" >}} would make an appearance.
