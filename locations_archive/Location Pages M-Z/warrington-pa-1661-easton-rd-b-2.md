## History

Warrington held its grand opening on November 30th, 2004, with the 2000s version of the 1992 Major Remodel with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} game package. This store also had a 16m Studio C Beta, which was common then. In 2006-2007, this store would get the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative, which would remove the majority of all 1990s fixtures and decorations. The logo and awning would also be replaced. As of April 2024, Warrington is still open with the 2.0 Remodel.
