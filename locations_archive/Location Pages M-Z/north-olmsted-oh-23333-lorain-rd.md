**North Olmsted, OH (23333 Lorain Rd)** was a Pizza Time Theatre which opened in December 1981 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. It should not be confused with {{< wiki-link "North Olmsted, OH (26104 Great Northern Sh)" >}} which was the Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened in January 1993 with a 2-Stage and still open to this day with the 2.0 remodel. North Olmsted would eventually become one of 5 Pizza Time Theatres to be rebranded as Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace. Now a CVS and Dollar General occupy what was once this location.

## History

North Olmsted opened in December 1981 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. At some point the Balcony Stage would be retrofitted to a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} which it would have until the location closed. No photos exist of the location as a Pizza Time Theatre. In December 1991, Marc Glassman, owner of the Marc's grocery chain, purchased the Olmsted Pizza Time Theatre when the franchise owner left the area, and the store was converted to Marc's Funtime Pizza Palace. He also purchased the Boardman, Akron, Columbus (Columbus Square), and Mentor locations. Like the other Marc's locations, the Olmsted location would keep the existing stage, but convert the characters into Marc, Rita, Ally, Fletch, and Chops. The closure of this location happened sometime in the mid-late 1990s along with the demolition of the building.
