## History

San Diego/Mira Mesa opened its doors in January 1982 as a franchised location and was apart of the Scripps Ranch Shopping Center which was completed in Fall 1981. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of information of San Diego/Mira Mesa back as a PTT. On October 22nd, 1984, the location was sold to corporate along with 50 other locations. In 1988 or 1989, San Diego/Mira Mesa received the 1988 remodel removing all PTT decor, adding CU decor, an exterior change, and the removal of the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. Around the Late 90's, the location received the so-called 'Phase 2' remodel removing older 90's decor, adding newer decor, another exterior change, SkyTubes, and replacing Chuck E.'s House Facade with a 2-stage. San Diego/Mira Mesa would remain like this until 2006 when they received the 2005 remodel removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, removing the Late 90's and early 2000's decor for newer decor, a new exterior change, and the relocation of the entire showroom. In 2020, after the permanent closure of Vista, CA (1861 University Dr), they received all of their tables, chairs, benches, and booths, and installed them in place of their old furniture. In February 2024, Mira Mesa started it's {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, and had removed it's 2-Stage on February 18, 2024. Currently, as of August 2024, the store remains like this with the 2.0 Remodel.

## Stages

Originally, San Diego/Mira Mesa featured a Balcony Stage. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of photos or videos to exist of San Diego/Mira Mesa with the Balcony Stage, and in general back then. In 1989, the Balcony Stage was removed for Chuck E.'s House Facade, then called the C-Stage. In 1997, Chuck E.'s House Facade was removed for the 2-Stage. In February 18, 2024, the 2-Stage was removed due to the 2.0 Remodel.
