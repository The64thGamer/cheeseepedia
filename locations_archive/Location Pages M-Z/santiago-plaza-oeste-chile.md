***Plaza Oeste, Chile*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* which opened on January 2, 2011 with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} show and closed on November 23, 2024 due to its relocation somewhere else inside the mall it was located in. It was the final location to open with a Cyberamic and a MMBB show.

## History

Plaza Oeste, opened on January 2nd, 2011, with the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}. This was the third Chuck E. Cheese's location that opened in Chile. The store layout was identical to most stores being opened around that time with the exception of their stage, being a 1-Stage that was formerly used in Mall Plaza Vespucio, a store that opened in 1996 and closed in 2000, the bots are also from the {{< wiki-link "Penfield Rochester, NY (1614 Penfield Rd)" >}} location, which closed on September 16, 1996. This was one of the last stores to host {{< wiki-link "Chuck E Cheese's Memory Match" >}} for a while before being removed. Avenger Chuck's walkaround was still rarely used in the store until 2019, as he was trashed during the pandemic. In 2017 and 2019 the store received new modern games to replace older ones. In December 2019, the location fixed its exterior including lights, paint and the store sign In 2021, the store received 2.0 art and painted a couple of purple walls white.

## Stage

The store has a Unique 1-Stage, which has been operating since opening. Chuck E's shorts and Munch's piano front were missing when the store opened but were installed in the following month. The stage uses a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} backdrop but is missing Chuck E's Star, Wink, the Munch's Make-Believe Band sign, Pasqually's text on the wall, helicopter light/gemini and curtains. It also has custom bricks for Pasqually's brick wall and the planters. Jasper sits on a real speaker while Pasqually uses a folding chair. In Early 2011, Chuck got a new mask replacing his old 90's mask. In Fall 2012 Chuck got his Avenger shorts which were lacking ever since the store opened. In April 2013, the Cyberstar was fixed as it was glitching badly. In 2015, they removed the spotlights for Chuck, Munch and Pasqually. In 2017, the rest of the spotlights were removed leaving only the Live show floods in the spotlight bar and a ADJ Jelly Ball was added (which was removed in December 2019) In May of 2019, the Cyberstar stopped recognizing the signals because of the DVD player being replaced causing the show to be in random mode indefinitely at the time. In December of 2019 the show finally started to work but now the Cyberstar presents glitches such as applying the signals to the wrong character or having a broken random mode.
