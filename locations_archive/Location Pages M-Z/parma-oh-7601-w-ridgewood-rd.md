Cheese's, featuring a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}} The store would remain practically untouched, save for Chuck's Late-Night outfit being replaced in 2008, the relocation of the {{< wiki-link "Skytubes" >}} from the front gameroom to the back gameroom in 2012, the disabling of the curtains in 2016 and the removal of the {{< wiki-link "Interactive Console" >}} and Blue Screen camera in 2016 and 2014, respectively, until 2016, At this time, Parmatown Mall, the shopping center the store is located in, was torn down and its plaza refurbished.

The interior of the store would keep its 1999 appearance until August 2017 when Parma was ordered to undergo the 2015 Remodel, along with {{< wiki-link "North Olmsted, OH (26104 Great Northern Sh)" >}} The store kept its showroom walls and balcony seating, which stores typically removed while remodeling.
