## Stages

National City opened with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. Unfortunately, there is no information on it during the PTT era. In 1989/1990, the {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}} was removed for {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. In around 1994, {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} was removed for the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. The bots would eventually be replaced with the ones from {{< wiki-link "San Diego, CA (3146 Sports Arena Blvd)" >}} in 2004. The stage went through minor cosmetic changes until 2011, when it got converted into a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}. In November 2023, the 1-Stage was removed for the Dance Floor and Video Wall.

## History

National City opened in May 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}. Although 1 exterior photo exists, there is basically nothing known about National City during the PTT era. In 1989/1990, National City received the {{< wiki-link "SPT 1980's Remodel Program" >}}, removing all PTT traces and removed the Balcony Stage for {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}}. Around 1994, National City received {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}}, removing all 1980s decor and removed {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House Facade" >}} for a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}}. They would later receive Phase {{< wiki-link "Phase 2 (1997)" >}}/{{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} at later dates. In 2007/2008, National City received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}, removing all 90s decor, removing showroom walls, balcony seating, replaced the lighting, and likely relocated the stage. The store would expand in 2011, converting the {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} to a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}. National City started the 2.0 remodel in November 2023.
