***305 W Catalina Dr*** was a ShowBiz Pizza Place that opened on January 30, 1984 (date might not be correct), and closed in the mid-80s (1984-1986, date completely unknown) with a Rock-afire Classic Stage. Not much is known about this location. This is not to be confused with Yuma, AZ (1348 S Yuma Palms Pkwy), which opened on December 29, 2004, and is still open today with the 2.0 remodel.

## Stages

This location opened with a Rock-afire Explosion stage. Not much is known about their history and was removed in the mid-80s when they closed.

## History

Yuma opened on January 30, 1984 (date might not be correct) with a Rock-afire Explosion, Sadly, information on this location is very hard to find, as it was either undocumented or short lived. In the mid-80s (1984-1986, date completely unknown), the location shut its doors, leaving Phoenix and Mesa as the only 2 ShowBiz Pizzas in the state of Arizona. The location was later split into multiple businesses, and they are still there as of July 2023.
