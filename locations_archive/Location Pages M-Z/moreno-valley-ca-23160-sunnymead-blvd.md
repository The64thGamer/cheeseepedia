## History

Moreno Valley opened on March 11, 2002, alongside the Frederick, MD (7210 Guilford Dr). In around 2008, Moreno Valley received the 2005 Update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved removing the dim lights for bright florescent lighting, painting some of the walls purple, an expansion, making more room for games, leaving most of the exterior untouched. In the Mid 2010's the awnings were removed from the building's exterior. The store remained this way until December 2022 when they received 2.0, removing the Beta for Dance Floor &amp; Video Wall, all items from the 2005 Remodel, &amp; the Phase 3 Exterior (Temporarily Except the Phase 3 signage, Repainting the building). On May 18, 2023, the Phase 3 signage was removed and was replaced with 2.0 signage.
