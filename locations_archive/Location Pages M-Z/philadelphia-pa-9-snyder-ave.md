## History

Philadelphia on Snyder Ave opened on September 15th, 1992 with a {{< wiki-link "2-Stage" >}} (A decade, a month, and week after the {{< wiki-link "Philadelphia, PA (9175 Roosevelt Blvd)" >}} location opened) with the CEC 1988 Remodel|1988 Remodel. The store remained relatively unchanged until the Mid 1990's when they received {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} (Which involved the removal of elements from the 1988 remodel such as The Blue &amp; White Awnings, checkers around the store, &amp; neon lights). Then in the Early 2000's they remodeled to remove the Balcony Seating &amp; Showroom Walls. It is unknown if this location ever received the Cool Chuck outfit. By 2010-2011, the Cool Chuck outfit was replaced with the Avenger outfit. Snyder would remodel again to receive the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative in Mid 2011; involving the removal of the Dinner Lights, 90's Decorations, &amp; added Purple Walls. Chuck's cap was removed in September 2013. Throughout the 2010's, the Snyder 2-Stage underwent numerous changes including the replacement of masks, &amp; Chuck's outfit to Rockstar. The store would remain this way until June-July 2022 when Snyder received the 2.0 Remodel which involved the removal of the 2-Stage, moving the Dance Floor &amp; Video Wall to face the back wall. As of February 2023, Snyder still has the 2.0 Remodel and the Dance Floor.
