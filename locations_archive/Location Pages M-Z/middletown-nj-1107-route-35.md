## History

Middletown opened as part of the Middletown Marketplace strip center in July 1994. They opened with the 1-Stage with a turntable. Middletown's 1-Stage was one of six installed in New Jersey, and was the last operating 1-Stage in the state. It's possible that they did receive the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 game packages at one point. They would also receive a Thumb Cool Chuck sign at some point in the mid-to-late '90s. Between August 2007 and January 2011, they received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} ({{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}}), renovating the store by updating the exterior with the Thumb Avenger Chuck sign, new wall decor. Around September 2016, the Middletown Marketplace would get a major exterior overhaul, renovating the exterior to the entire strip center. As a result, the Middletown Chuck E. Cheese's would also see an major exterior renovation, getting rid of the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} Avenger Chuck sign in favor of the new at the time 2015 Waving Rockstar Chuck sign as a result. The interior would not impacted by this, only the exterior. On June 2, 2024, the store would begin its 2.0 Remodel, removing the stage that night.
