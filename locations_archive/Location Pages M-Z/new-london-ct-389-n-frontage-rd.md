***389 N Frontage Rd, Store #650*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened on May 16, 1994, with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}}, and closed on May 11, 2014, due to leasing issues.

## History

New London opened on May 16th, 1994, as a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza with a 1-Stage (Which was one of three installed in the state of Connecticut). New London opened with a 1992 or 1993 version of the interior stylings from the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program. This was one of two New England locations that had a 1-Stage with a Turntable (The other being the {{< wiki-link "Warwick, RI (1245 Bald Hill Rd)" >}} location which that store closed a few months after it was installed, making it the shortest lasting 1-Stage overall). In the Mid-Late 1990s, New London would receive the {{< wiki-link "Phase 1 (1994)" >}} remodel, removing a couple of pieces of older decor for newer decor and removing the ball pit for SkyTubes. The store would remain this way until its closure on May 11th, 2014, due to leasing issues. In 2018, the building was demolished for a Bob’s Discount Furniture and Mattress Store. As of April 2024, the site is still Bob’s Discount Furniture and Mattress Store.

## Trivia

- New London was one of two 1-Stages in New England to have the 1-Stage with a Turntable, the other was {{< wiki-link "Warwick, RI (1245 Bald Hill Rd)" >}} which installed theirs around a similar time frame as New London (Warwick's however replaced a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}} instead of being a new store) and closed a few months later, making that store have the shortest lasting 1-Stage and the first overall to be removed from a store (It was then auctioned off in January 1995; the show was them retrofitted into The Traveling Theme Park Band/Zachary and The Other Singing Groups and as of June 2023, the show remains thus way but it's now restored mechanically). New London however kept theirs until closure with numerous changes made to it over the years.
