## History

Meriden opened on January 30, 2002 with the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} remodel and a Studio C Beta. Unfortunately, not much is known about this location, other than a few videos that were taken throughout Meriden's history. Meriden was left untouched until May 19, 2013, when they would permanently close due to leasing issues. The building sat vacant for a short period until it was gutted and was split up between a GMC shop and PetSmart. As of July 2023, they are still there.
