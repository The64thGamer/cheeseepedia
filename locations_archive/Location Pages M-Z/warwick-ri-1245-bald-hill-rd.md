***1245 Bald Hill Rd*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza* location that opened in Late 1990 with a Rocker Stage. It was located in the Bald Hill Plaza next to the now demolished Lechmere (Which closed when the company went out of business in 1997). This is not to be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Warwick, RI (1960 Post Rd)" >}} location which opened in June 1984 and closed in Late 1990 with the {{< wiki-link "Family Album" >}} Stage. This is also not to be confused with the {{< wiki-link "Warwick, RI (650 Bald Hill Rd)" >}} which opened on March 6th, 2000, and was the first location in New England to open with Studio C; that store is still operation to this day.

## History

Warwick opened in the Bald Hill Plaza as a relocation to the {{< wiki-link "Warwick, RI (1960 Post Rd)" >}} location in Late 1990 with a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E's House" >}}. In around 1992/1993, Jasper's shirt would be replaced with the 1992 cowprint shirt. It would remain until sometime in 1994, when the store was remodeled to the 1992 update to the 1994 SPT Repositioning / Remodel Program; it was replaced with a {{< wiki-link "1-Stage" >}} with a Turntable (One of two in New England; the other was in {{< wiki-link "New London, CT (389 N Frontage Rd)" >}}) (it was also possible that the store remained unremodeled and only converted the Chuck E.'s House Facade to a 1-Stage). The 1-Stage would remain for a few months until November 19, 1994, when the store was closed permanently, and everything was auctioned off in January 1995. Shortly after closure, the space was converted into Hometown Buffet; they closed in Early 2012. in Late 2012, it was converted into Hibachi Grill &amp; Supreme Buffet. As of March 2023, Hibachi Grill &amp; Supreme Buffet still remains in the space. Sometime after the show was auctioned off, it was retrofitted into The Travelling Theme Park Band. As of 2023, the show is still The Travelling Theme Park Band and has been restored to operational condition recently.
