***4703 West Loop 250, Store #928*** is a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on October 2, 2000, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta Prototype" >}}, which is still open to this day. Midland would be the 4th of 5 Studio C Prototypes to be installed, and was the last from March 2022 when the Athens, Georgia location removed their Beta Prototype for their 2.0 Remodel, until October 18, 2022, when Midland would remove their Studio C Beta Prototype, also for their 2.0 Remodel.

## Stages

When Midland opened, they featured the rare {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta Prototype" >}}, which was only installed in 4 other locations (Athens, Georgia in March 2000, Brownsville and Tyler, Texas in July 2000, and Clarksville, Tennessee in February 2001). Midland's Beta Prototype did not feature a side TV like Clarksville, Tennessee and Tyler, Texas, and also did not feature a Pizza Time Clock. Midland remodeled to the 2.0 Remodel in October 2022, removing their Beta Prototype for a Dance Floor and Video Wall on October 18, 2022. Midland was the last Studio C Beta Prototype in operation, as the other 4 were remodeled to 2.0 between September 2019 and March 2022.

## History

Midland opened on October 2, 2000, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Beta Prototype" >}}, in which Midland was the 4th installed, and the last Beta Prototype installed in the year 2000. Midland did not feature a side TV like Clarksville, Tennessee and Tyler, Texas, or a Pizza Time Clock. Before their 2.0 Remodel, Midland featured a one of a kind 2005 Avenger Chuck exterior sign that featured a yellow shirt (with a yellow C), green elbow pads, and a red hat, unlike most others, which have a purple shirt and purple and green hat (Paramus, New Jersey also has a unique 2005 Avenger exterior sign, although theirs has a red shirt and red and green hat).
