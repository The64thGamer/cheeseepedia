***Newport, KY (301 Riverboat Row)*** was a cancelled Pizza Time Theatre location meant to be held on a Cincinnati River boat, which began plans around 1981.

## History

The concept would begin sometime in 1981, being a pitch by BB Riverboats to franchise a Pizza Time Theatre to overtake their first boat, the Mike Fink, which held the Mike Fink Restaurant.<sup>(2)</sup> This would mean the infrastructure would already be in place to run the chain from the boat. A concept piece would be drawn of the boat docked at Newport, KY (301 Riverboat Row) by the W.L. Hay Company.
Eventually, this concept would not come to fruition due to unknown factors. BB Riverboats however would continue it's franchising plans with Pizza Time Theatre, and open the {{< wiki-link "Florence, KY (7635 Mall Rd)" >}} store later in April of 1982 under the Bernstein Restaurant Group. The franchisee would further own 3 more locations in later years.<sup>(3)(4)</sup>
Eventually the bots of the Florence location would appear on a BB Riverboats owned attraction, that being *The USS Nightmare*, a haunted-house set on a riverboat. The mechs would appear in an unknown year as unmoving background props in one of the sets, and are still there to present day.<sup>(1)</sup> The location currently sits as both the Beer Sellar and Hooters restaurants.<sup>(5)</sup>
