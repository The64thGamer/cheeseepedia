## History

West Long Branch opened at the Consumer Centre on November 20, 2000, with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Alpha" >}}, the 1999 version of the SPT 1992/1993 Remodel Program, and the {{< wiki-link "Phase 3 (2000)" >}} game package. There would be little to no change to the store over the years, and the store would ultimately closed permanently on September 21, 2015, mostly likely due to underperformance or a leasing disagreement. The sign and everything inside the store was removed by the end of the month. After closure, the exterior would be updated due to remodeling at the Consumer Centre in 2016. Since 2016 or 2017, the former CEC would be use by Spirit Halloween for the halloween season. As of September 2023, West Long Branch has yet to find a permanent retailer to occupy the former CEC.
