***8357 Laurel Canyon Blvd*** was a Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre that opened on July 7, 1980(1) with a Portrait Stage and closed in July 1992 (day unknown) with Chuck E.'s House Facade. This location relocated to the {{< wiki-link "Sun Valley, CA (8375 Laurel Canyon Blvd)" >}} which opened in July 1992 (day unknown) with a Road Stage and is still open to this very day.

## Stages

Sun Valley opened with a Portrait Stage. It would only last 1-2 years, because in 1981/1982, it was replaced with a Balcony Stage. In 1989/1990, without remodeling, the store received Chuck E.'s House Facade. That also wouldn't last long, as in July 1992, the store relocated.

## History

Sun Valley opened on July 7, 1980 as the 12th Pizza Time Theatre to open. In 1981/1982, the location would receive a minor remodel, switching out the 1970s exterior sign for the new 1981 logo, and replaced the Portrait Stage with the Balcony Stage. Not much is known about this location, although a few photos might have been found, but no videos. In 1989/1990, they removed the Balcony Stage for Chuck E.'s House Facade. This location apparently did not receive the 1988 remodel, although many other locations in California received it by this point, but recieved the Chuck E Cheese's Pizza sign. In July 1992 (day unknown), for unknown reasons (one reason might be that it was behind on remodeling), the location moved to ***8375 Laurel Canyon Blvd***, which was just a few stores down. As of July 2023, the location has been split up by multiple businesses.
