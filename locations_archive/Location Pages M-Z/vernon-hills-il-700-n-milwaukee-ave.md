## History

700 N Milwaukee Ave opened on April 8, 2004 with the Phase 3 remodel and a Studio C Beta stage. For most of the location's life, barely anything would be changed. A few things would occur, however, that being the removal of the dim lighting and a few of the posters, and Chuck's attire being changed to his Avenger attire. At some point after the introduction of Rockstar Chuck, the bot's cap would be removed and his Avenger shorts would be replaced with the Rockstar pants. Though his Avenger shirt would be kept. In September 2019, the location would receive its first and only remodel. That being the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2.0 Remodel Program" >}}, which resulted in the Studio C Beta stage being removed. The fate of the bot remains unknown. After the remodel, the store would remain open for a few more months until June 2020, where the store would permanently close due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Post-Closure

The building would remain vacant for a while until Liquor Barn moved in. The interior would be gutted, the exterior would be repainted and the doors would be replaced with automatic doors, thus leaving no remnants from *Chuck E. Cheese's* behind. As of July 2025, Liquor Barn is still in the space to this day.
