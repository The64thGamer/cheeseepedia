## History

Sacramento (Arden) opened in February 1982, as a Pizza Time Theatre and as part of an expansion of the shopping center it was in. It was also a franchise-owned location. Unfortunately, there is some information on this location when it was a PTT but not a lot of information when it had the 1988 Remodel. It opened with a Balcony Stage and the Showroom was called 'The Theater'. It was bought by the corporate on October 22nd, 1984 along with the Stockton Blvd location and 49 others. Sacramento (Arden) then received the 1988 Remodel in 1988 or 1989 which includes removing the PTT decor for the CU decor, adding checkers around the store, the Blue and White awnings, and removing the Balcony Stage for the C-Stage. In the Early-90's, Sacramento (Arden) would receive a minor remodel which added a lot of 1990s decor and removed the CU decor, and added assets such as the Record Posters, Colored Chase Lights, redoing the exterior, renaming the store to 'Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza', renaming 'The Theater' to 'Showroom', and the removal of the C-Stage for the 2-Stage. In the Late 90's, Sacramento (Arden) would receive the Phase 2 remodel removing older 90's decor for newer decor, redoing the exterior again, renaming the store again to just 'Chuck E. Cheese's', and removed the ball pit for SkyTubes. In 2008-2009, Sacramento (Arden) would receive the 2005 update to the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative which involved the repainting of the exterior and store, the removal of the early 2000's posters, the new decor and booths, removing the Showroom Walls, Balcony Seating, and the relocation of the 2-Stage. On January 22nd, 2024, the store would remove its 2-Stage as the store started its 2.0 Remodel. Around that year, The Trampoline Zone was added to the Location.

## Stages

Originally, Sacramento (Arden) had a Balcony Stage when it first opened in February 1982. In 1988-1989, they would receive the C-Stage. In the Early 90's, most likely around 1992 or 1993, the C-Stage was replaced by the 2-Stage. On January 22nd, 2024, the store would remove its 1-Stage in favor of its 2.0 Remodel.
