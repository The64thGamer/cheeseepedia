***4631 Commercial Dr*** was a *Chuck E. Cheese's* that opened on October 30, 2006 with a {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}, which closed in June 2020 during a wave of closures due to the company's bankruptcy. This location is not to be confused with the *Pizza Time Theatre* location, {{< wiki-link "New Hartford Utica, NY (8555 Seneca Turnpike)" >}}, which was open from 1982-1985.

## Stages

The location opened with the 'V3' variant of the {{< wiki-link "Studio C Cappa" >}}. The stage remained intact until the location's closure. The animatronic had its eyebrows and hat removed at some point during its history.
