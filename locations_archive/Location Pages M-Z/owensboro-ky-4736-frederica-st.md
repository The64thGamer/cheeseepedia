**4736 Frederica St** was a ShowBiz Pizza that opened in October 6th, 1985 with a Rock-Afire Explosion and closed in November 1995 (day unknown) with a 3-Stage.

## History

Owensboro opened on October 6th, 1985 as a franchised ShowBiz Pizza Place with a Rock-Afire Explosion. Owensboro stayed the same after opening until in 1989 when they received the 1988 remodel removing older SPP decor and adding newer SPP decor. The location was bought in 1990 (month and day unknown) by the corporate along with {{< wiki-link "Simi Valley, CA (71 Tierra Rejada Rd)" >}}. In 1991, they received Concept Unification which involves the removal of the Rock-Afire Explosion for the 3-Stage, the removal of all SPP decor, and the addition of a new exterior and CEC decor. They remained like this until they closed in November 1995 for unknown reasons. In 1997, the location was transformed into a Cici's Pizza with all CEC remnants removed. It was very short lived, and it closed in 1999. In 2000 or 2001, it became a Buffalo Wild Wings. Currently, as of February 2023, the Buffalo Wild Wings is still there.

## Stages

Originally when the store opened, they had a Rock-Afire Explosion. Unfortunately, there are exterior and interior photos as a ShowBiz Pizza, but there are no photos of the exterior or interior as Chuck E. Cheese and there was one video of Owensboro's 3-Stage, but it was lost as it came from a deleted Instagram account. In 1991, they received Concept Unification which turned the Rock-afire Explosion into Munch's Make Believe Band. The 3-Stage remained until the November 1995 closure.
