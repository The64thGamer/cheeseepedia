Mentor opened with the 1993 remodel which included Record Posters and other decor, SkyTubes and Toddler Zone, and the 1-Stage. In 2006, Mentor received the {{< wiki-link "CEC 2000's Remodel Program" >}} removing older decor for newer decor, removing Showroom Walls, removed Toddler Zone, relocated the 1-Stage, and relocated some parts of the store like the kitchen area, salad bar, some games and added newer games, booths, and tables.
