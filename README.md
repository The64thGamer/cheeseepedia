The animatronic archival website, Cheese-E-Pedia! The site originally ran on MediaWiki through Miraheze, and it is now a Hugo static site that runs right here on GitHub!

The site itself gives instructions on how to contribute in the "Contributor Home" linked on the homepage. Context is given mostly for people who have never used GitHub or done Git merges, but if you're someone already well versed in this type of stuff, I'd encourage reading the general site rules and glancing over things. Any contribution to a page should have your username listed in the contributors, and the page's date updated to today.
